## Overview / Definition

Mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers) are small, painful sores inside the mouth.  
They are usually benign and heal in 1–2 weeks. Triggers include minor trauma, stress, certain foods, or vitamin deficiencies.  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mouth-ulcers/))

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Round/oval sore with red edge and yellow/white center  
- Pain with eating, drinking, or speaking  
- Sometimes mild fever or swollen glands with multiple ulcers  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mouth-ulcers/))

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek care if:  
- Ulcers last longer than 3 weeks or keep returning frequently  
- Very large ulcers, severe pain, or difficulty eating/drinking  
- Ulcers with fever, rash, weight loss, or genital ulcers

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Avoid spicy, acidic, or rough foods; use a soft toothbrush  
- Rinse with saltwater; maintain good oral hygiene  
- Pain relief as advised by a professional  
- Identify and avoid personal food triggers if suspected  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mouth-ulcers/))

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Manage stress; sleep well and eat balanced diet  
- Treat iron, B12, or folate deficiency if present (under medical guidance)  
- Protect mouth from minor trauma (e.g., dental wax for braces)  
(Source: [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431059/))

## Special considerations

- Children may reduce eating due to pain — ensure fluids and soft foods.  
- Voice-first prompts: “Rinse mouth,” “Soft foods,” “See dentist if >3 weeks.”
