## Overview / Definition

Dry eye happens when your eyes do not make enough tears or tears evaporate too quickly.  
Causes include screen time, contact lenses, dry air, some medicines, and aging.  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dry-eyes/))

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Dryness, burning, stinging  
- Gritty sensation, tired eyes  
- Blurred vision that improves after blinking  
- Watery eyes (reflex tearing)  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dry-eyes/))

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek care if:  
- Persistent pain, redness, or light sensitivity  
- Vision changes, trauma, or suspected infection  
- Symptoms do not improve with basic self-care  
(Source: [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470125/))

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Blink often; follow 20–20–20 screen rule  
- Use preservative-free lubricating drops as advised  
- Manage environment: humidify air, avoid smoke/wind  
- Review contact lens hygiene and wear time  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dry-eyes/))

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Limit long screen sessions; take breaks  
- Stay hydrated; balanced diet (omega-3 rich foods may help)  
- Check medicines that worsen dryness with your clinician

## Special considerations

- Autoimmune conditions (e.g., Sjögren’s) may cause severe dry eye.  
- Voice-first prompts: “Use eye drops,” “Blink and rest,” “See eye clinic if pain.”
