## Overview / Definition

Otitis externa is inflammation or infection of the ear canal skin.  
It can follow water exposure, use of objects in the ear, skin conditions, or minor trauma.  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ear-infections/otitis-externa/))

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Ear pain (may be severe), worse when touching or moving the outer ear  
- Itch in the ear canal  
- Ear discharge, bad smell  
- Temporary hearing reduction or blocked feeling  
(Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/swimmers-ear/index.html))

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek urgent care if:  
- Fever, severe pain, or swelling around the ear  
- Spreading redness, severe discharge, or worsening symptoms  
- Diabetes, immune problems, or severe nighttime pain  
- Hearing loss that does not improve or sudden hearing loss  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ear-infections/otitis-externa/))

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Keep the ear dry; avoid swimming until better.  
- Do not insert cotton buds or objects.  
- Use pain relief as advised by a healthcare professional.  
- Follow any prescribed ear drops exactly as directed.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Dry ears after water with a towel; tilt head to drain water.  
- Avoid inserting objects; consider earplugs when swimming if prone to infection.  
- Manage skin conditions (eczema, dermatitis) around the ear.  
(Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/swimmers-ear/index.html))

## Special considerations

- Children may present with irritability or ear pulling.  
- People with diabetes or immune conditions need early assessment.  
- Voice-first use: short cues — “Keep ear dry,” “Do not poke ear,” “See doctor if fever.”
