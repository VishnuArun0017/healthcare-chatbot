## Overview / Definition

Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinus linings, often following a cold or allergies.  
It can cause facial pain, nasal blockage, and thick nasal mucus.  
(Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sinus-infection/index.html))

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Face pain/pressure (forehead, cheeks)  
- Blocked or runny nose, thick discharge  
- Reduced smell, post-nasal drip, cough  
- Fever, tiredness, bad breath in some cases  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sinusitis/))

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek care if:  
- Severe facial pain or swelling, high fever  
- Symptoms not improving after 7–10 days or worsening  
- Eye swelling, vision problems, severe headache, stiff neck  
(Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sinus-infection/index.html))

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Rest, fluids, steam or humidified air  
- Saline nasal irrigation; gentle nose blowing  
- Pain relief as advised by a professional  
- Allergy management if relevant

- Good indoor ventilation
