- Throbbing or sharp pain in a tooth  
- Sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek urgent dental care if:  
- Swelling in face or jaw, fever, or spreading pain  
- Difficulty swallowing or opening mouth  
- Severe pain not relieved by simple measures  
- Trauma with loose or knocked-out tooth

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Rinse mouth gently with warm water  
- Floss to remove trapped food; avoid sharp objects  
- Pain relief as advised by a professional  
- Cold compress outside cheek for swelling

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste; clean between teeth  
- Limit sugary snacks and drinks  
- Regular dental check-ups and mouthguard for sports

## Special considerations

- Children: report night pain, sensitivity, or visible holes early.  
- Voice-first prompts: “Call dentist now,” “Rinse and floss,” “Cold compress outside cheek.”
