## Overview / Definition

Earwax protects and cleans the ear canal.  
Sometimes it builds up and causes fullness, blocked feeling, or hearing reduction.  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/earwax-build-up/))

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Fullness, pressure, or itch in the ear  
- Reduced hearing or temporary tinnitus  
- Earache in some cases  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/earwax-build-up/))

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek care if:  
- Severe pain, discharge, dizziness, or sudden hearing loss  
- Symptoms persist despite softening drops  
- You use hearing aids, have a perforated eardrum, or ear surgery history  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/earwax-build-up/))

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Use earwax softening drops as advised.  
- Do not use cotton buds or insert objects.  
- Speak to a professional about microsuction or irrigation if needed.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Avoid routine ear cleaning with objects.  
- Manage skin conditions that increase wax.  
- Regular device care for hearing aid users.

## Special considerations

- Children and older adults may need supervised care.  
- Voice-first prompts: “Use softening drops,” “Do not poke ear,” “See nurse if not better.”
