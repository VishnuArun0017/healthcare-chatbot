## Overview / Definition

A nosebleed (epistaxis) is bleeding from the inside of the nose.  
It is common and usually mild; correct first aid often stops it.  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nosebleed/))

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Bleeding from one or both nostrils  
- Metallic taste, blood in saliva  
- Light-headedness if prolonged  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nosebleed/))

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek urgent care if:  
- Bleeding lasts longer than 10–15 minutes despite first aid  
- Heavy bleeding, feeling faint, or breathing difficulty  
- Nosebleed after head injury or on blood-thinning medicines  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nosebleed/))

## Evidence-backed self-care

1. Sit up, lean forward; do not lie back.  
2. Pinch the soft part of the nose for 10 minutes; breathe through mouth.  
3. Spit out blood; use a bowl/tissue.  
4. After bleeding stops, avoid blowing nose or heavy exertion for 24 hours.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Keep nasal passages moist (saline, humid air).  
- Avoid nose picking and forceful blowing.  
- Manage allergies and colds to reduce irritation.

## Special considerations

- Children: reassure, guide pinching correctly.  
- Voice-first: “Lean forward,” “Pinch nose 10 minutes,” “Call for help if bleeding persists.”
