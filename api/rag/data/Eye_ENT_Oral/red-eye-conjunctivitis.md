## Overview / Definition

Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the thin membrane covering the white of the eye and inner eyelids.  
It can be viral, bacterial, or allergic.  
(Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/index.html))

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Redness, tearing, gritty feeling  
- Discharge (watery or sticky), crusting on lashes  
- Itch (especially in allergies), mild light sensitivity  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/conjunctivitis/))

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek urgent care if:  
- Moderate to severe eye pain, blurred vision, light sensitivity  
- Symptoms after eye injury or chemical exposure  
- Worsening symptoms, or in a newborn infant  
(Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/index.html))

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Wash hands often; avoid touching eyes  
- Do not share towels, pillows, or eye cosmetics  
- Clean discharge with sterile cotton and cooled boiled water  
- Use cold compress for comfort; allergy management if relevant  
(Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/conjunctivitis/))

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Hand hygiene; avoid rubbing eyes  
- Replace eye cosmetics regularly; clean contact lenses safely  
- Stay home if eyes are very sticky/red (school/work policies may apply)  
(Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/index.html))

## Special considerations

- Contact lens wearers: stop lenses and seek advice  
- Voice-first prompts: “Wash hands,” “Do not share towels,” “See eye doctor if pain.”
