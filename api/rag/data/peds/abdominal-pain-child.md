## Overview / Definition  
Abdominal pain (often described as “tummy ache”) in children is quite common and can range from mild discomfort to more serious conditions. According to the Alder Hey Children’s Hospital guidance, most cases are **not serious** and will resolve on their own. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
However, some abdominal pain may signal a **serious underlying condition** if there are red-flag features present (e.g., appendicitis, bowel obstruction). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Some of the more common indicators that a child may need medical review:  
- General tummy ache or pain, maybe around the belly button, or lower abdomen. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Pain that may be intermittent, may worsen when the child moves, or may be associated with vomiting or diarrhoea. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Other less alarming causes include constipation, urinary tract infections, gastroenteritis, or viral illnesses. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

These signs do *not always* mean emergency care is required, but if the child is worried, sleep or play is disrupted, or the pain is persistent, you should seek medical review.

## Red flags & when to escalate  
You should seek **urgent or emergency medical help** (for example call 999 or the local emergency number) if you observe any of the following signs:  
- Pain which is sudden in onset, very severe, or the child becomes pale, floppy or is difficult to wake. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Vomit that is green (bile) or contains blood; black or very dark stool; or inability to pass urine or stool. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Pain that moves to the right-hand side of the tummy (suggesting possible appendicitis) or very swollen abdomen. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Rash that does not fade under pressure (“non-blanching”), breathing problems, or other signs of shock or systemic illness. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

You should also seek prompt medical review (e.g., same day) if:  
- The child has constant pain lasting more than a day despite pain relief. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Pain with fever, blood in urine or stool, or persistent vomiting/diarrhoea. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
If no red flags are present and the child appears well, you may apply home care while monitoring:  
1. Encourage the child to rest and drink plenty of fluids (to avoid dehydration). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
2. Use age-appropriate pain relief, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (following correct dosage) when needed. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
3. Offer light, bland food if hungry; do not force them to eat. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
4. Monitor the child closely — if symptoms worsen, new signs appear, or the child is not improving, seek medical help.  
5. Avoid letting the child lie immobilised all day; light activity may help if tolerated.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Maintain a diet with adequate fibre and hydration to avoid constipation (a common cause of tummy pain).  
- Encourage regular toileting and avoid “holding on” for bowel movements.  
- Promote good hygiene (hand-washing) to reduce risk of tummy bugs and gastroenteritis.  
- Ensure the child has regular check-ups and that you respond promptly when symptoms change.

## Special considerations  
- **Infants and very young children (< 1 year):** They are less able to verbalise pain, so a lower threshold for medical review is needed.  
- **Children with chronic illnesses** (e.g., previous abdominal surgery, known GI disease) need more careful monitoring.  
- **Recurrent or long-term abdominal pain:** In children with repeated episodes over weeks/months but no acute signs, the cause may be ‘functional abdominal pain’ (pain without structural disease) — reassurance and follow-up may be needed. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Adolescents:** Consider menstrual or gynaecological causes in girls (e.g., ovarian torsion) when appropriate.
