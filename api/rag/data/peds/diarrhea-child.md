## Overview / Definition  
Diarrhoea in children is defined as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools in a 24-hour period.  
 According to the World Health Organization, diarrhoeal disease remains one of the leading causes of death in children under five globally. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
Most episodes in children are caused by viral infections and resolve safely at home, but certain signs mean you should seek urgent or specialist help.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Typical symptoms (may need review):  
- Increase in loose/watery stools.  
- Mild fever, vomiting, irritability, reduced appetite.  
- Increased thirst, more frequent urination or fewer wet nappies (infants).

Warning signs needing medical review:  
- Blood or mucus in stools. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Vomiting persists >24-48 hours or frequent vomiting preventing fluids. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Signs of dehydration: fewer wet nappies, sunken eyes/fontanelle, dry mouth, cold extremities. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- High fever, severe abdominal pain, or child becoming very tired/unresponsive. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Call your local emergency number or seek urgent care if any of the following occur:  
- Child becomes very floppy, unresponsive, has seizures or breathing difficulty.  
- Vomit is green (bilious), or stool has blood. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Child cannot keep fluids down at all; shows signs of **severe dehydration** (no urine for 12 hours in baby, sunken fontanelle). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Diarrhoea lasts **more than 7 days** or worsens instead of improving. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
  
## Evidence-backed self-care  
While waiting for resolution or if mild:  
1. Encourage **small frequent fluids** (oral rehydration solutions if available) to prevent dehydration. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
2. Continue regular feeding or breastfeeding — do *not* stop food unless advised. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
3. Monitor for worsening signs — more stools, inability to drink, lethargy.  
4. Avoid giving over-the-counter anti-diarrhoeal medications unless under medical advice.  
5. Maintain hygiene: frequent hand washing, safe food & water for child and siblings.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Ensure vaccinations are up to date (rotavirus if available, others).  
- Promote **safe drinking water**, good sanitation, and hand hygiene.  
- In travel or unsafe water settings, use bottled or boiled water and avoid risky foods.  
- Educate caregivers about early signs of dehydration or worsening condition.

## Special considerations  
- **Infants (< 3 months)** – any diarrhoea calls for medical review due to higher risk.  
- **Children with malnutrition or chronic illness** – higher risk of complications and slower recovery.  
- **Settings with limited clean water or sanitation** – more cautious monitoring and early help.  
- **After travel abroad** – consider other causes of persistent diarrhoea (parasites, imports) and seek specialist if needed.
