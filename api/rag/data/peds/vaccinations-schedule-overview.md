## Overview / Definition
Vaccination (or immunization) protects individuals and communities from infectious diseases by stimulating the body’s immune system to recognize and fight harmful pathogens.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/immunization), vaccines prevent **4–5 million deaths every year** and are one of the most cost-effective health interventions globally.

Following the recommended vaccination schedule helps ensure timely protection — especially for infants, children, and older adults — against diseases like measles, polio, influenza, and COVID-19.

## Common vaccine categories
Based on [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/immunization), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/), and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/) guidelines, vaccines are usually grouped as follows:

- **Childhood vaccines** – BCG, Hepatitis B, DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis), Polio (OPV/IPV), Hib, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus, Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR).  
- **Adolescent vaccines** – HPV (Human Papillomavirus), Tdap booster, Meningococcal vaccines.  
- **Adult vaccines** – Seasonal influenza, COVID-19 boosters, Hepatitis B (for healthcare workers or risk groups), Tdap every 10 years.  
- **Older adult vaccines** – Pneumococcal, Influenza (annual), Shingles (Herpes Zoster).  
- **Special vaccines** – Rabies, Typhoid, Japanese Encephalitis, Yellow Fever (for travellers or risk areas).

Vaccines may vary slightly depending on national health programs — always check your local schedule (e.g., India’s [Universal Immunization Programme](https://main.mohfw.gov.in/Organisation/Departments-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare/immunization)).

## Red flags & when to delay or seek medical advice
While most vaccines are safe and well-tolerated, seek medical advice **before vaccination** if:
- The person has a **severe allergic reaction** (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous vaccine dose.  
- There is **moderate or severe illness** (high fever, vomiting, or infection) at the time of vaccination.  
- The person is **immunocompromised** or on chemotherapy/steroids — special timing or types of vaccines may be required.  
- There is a **history of Guillain-Barré syndrome** after vaccination (rare).  

In such cases, a healthcare professional will assess whether to proceed, delay, or modify the schedule.

## Evidence-backed self-care & aftercare
Based on [CDC vaccine guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf) and [NHS vaccination advice](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/what-to-expect-after-vaccination/):
1. **Mild side effects** like soreness, redness, or low fever are normal and usually settle within 1–2 days.  
2. Apply a **cool compress** to the injection site to ease discomfort.  
3. Encourage **fluids and rest** after vaccination.  
4. **Do not skip doses** — complete the full vaccine series for full protection.  
5. Report any **serious or unusual reaction** (e.g., difficulty breathing, high fever, rash, persistent vomiting) to a doctor or local health authority immediately.

## Prevention / lifestyle
Vaccination doesn’t replace healthy habits — it complements them.  
- Keep your **immunization record** up to date and stored safely.  
- **Check booster needs** every few years (e.g., tetanus every 10 years).  
- Ensure **pregnant women** receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Tdap, influenza).  
- **Travelers** should consult doctors 4–6 weeks before trips for travel-specific vaccines.  
- Promote **community awareness** — herd immunity protects vulnerable populations.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Early completion of vaccines builds lifelong protection.  
- **Pregnancy:** Vaccines like Tdap and influenza are safe and protect both mother and baby.  
- **Elderly:** Ageing reduces immune response — boosters are essential.  
- **Chronic illness:** Those with diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease should stay up to date with flu, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines.
