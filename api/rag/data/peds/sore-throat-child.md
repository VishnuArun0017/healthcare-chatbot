## Overview / Definition  
A sore throat in children is pain, scratchiness or irritation of the throat that often becomes worse when swallowing.  
Most sore throats in children are caused by viral infections and improve without antibiotics. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
However, it’s important to recognise when a sore throat might signal something more serious—such as a bacterial infection or airway problem.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Typical signs of a common sore throat in children:  
- Child complains of throat pain or dislikes swallowing. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- May have a runny nose or cough (suggesting a viral cause). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Slight fever, tiredness, less interest in food or drink.

These do not always require urgent care, but they need monitoring.

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek **urgent medical help** (call emergency services or go to A&E) if your child has any of the following:  
- Trouble breathing or swallowing, drooling excessively. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Child becomes very drowsy, floppy, or difficult to wake. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- High fever that does not reduce, or persistent rash, stiff neck, or signs of dehydration (no tears, few wet nappies). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Child cannot swallow their own saliva or opens their mouth with difficulty. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

Seek **prompt medical review** (GP/urgent care) if:  
- Sore throat lasts more than 3-5 days without improvement. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Child has repeated sore throats, very swollen glands in neck, or high risk underlying condition. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
If the child is stable and none of the red flags are present:  
1. Encourage **plenty of fluids**, soft cool foods (ice-lollies) & rest. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
2. Use age-appropriate pain relief (e.g., paracetamol or ibuprofen) for throat pain and fever. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
3. Avoid smoking exposure, keep environment cool and restful. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
4. Monitor for any worsening signs or new symptoms (rash, breathing difficulty, dehydration).  
5. Most viral sore throats improve within a week.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Teach and practice **good hand hygiene** and cough etiquette to reduce spread of infections. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Ensure child’s vaccinations are up to date (e.g., for diphtheria, influenza).  
- Avoid exposure to second-hand smoke or irritants which can worsen throat symptoms.  
- Encourage adequate sleep and healthy nutrition to support immune system.

## Special considerations  
- **Very young infants (< 3 months)**: any throat pain, difficulty feeding or temperature ≥38°C needs prompt review. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Children with weakened immune systems or chronic illnesses**: lower threshold for seeking medical advice.  
- **Repeated frequent sore throats** (e.g., more than 6/year) may need specialist review. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
