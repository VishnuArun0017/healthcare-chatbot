## Overview / Definition  
A cough or cold in children typically refers to an upper respiratory viral infection — runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and cough — which most children recover from in about 1 to 2 weeks.  
The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html) notes that many respiratory viruses cause colds and most resolve with symptomatic care. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
However, such illnesses can sometimes evolve into more serious conditions (bronchiolitis, pneumonia) especially in infants, so it's important to monitor for warning signs.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Typical symptoms:  
- Runny or blocked nose, sneezing. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Mild fever, sore throat, cough. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Irritability, reduced appetite or fluid intake.

Signs that need *urgent review*:  
- Breathing difficulty: fast breathing, chest / rib indrawing, flaring nostrils. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Blue lips, tongue or pale/mottled skin. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- High fever in a baby under 3 months old. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Persistent fever or cough lasting more than 2-3 weeks. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Not drinking, very few wet nappies (infants) → dehydration risk. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Call emergency services or seek urgent medical care if your child:  
- Has blue lips or face, stops breathing, or has irregular breathing pauses. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Is very drowsy, unresponsive, or inconsolable. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Displays chest pain when breathing/coughing, or is very short of breath. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Has a very high temperature (especially in a very young baby) or worrying rash. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
For children with mild cough / cold:  
1. Ensure **plenty of clear fluids** to prevent dehydration. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
2. Ensure **adequate rest** and a comfortable, well-ventilated room.  
3. For nasal congestion: use saline nasal drops or suction bulb (infants). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
4. Honey (for children >1 year) can ease cough (not for under 1 yr). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
5. Avoid use of over-the-counter cough/cold medicines in young children (especially under 6 yrs) due to safety concerns. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
6. Monitor symptoms—if they persist beyond expected timeframe (1-2 weeks) or worsen, consult a health professional.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Teach and practise **hand-washing** frequently and good cough/sneeze etiquette. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Keep immunisations up to date (e.g., flu vaccine) to prevent complications.  
- Avoid exposure to smoke and ensure the child isn’t in very dry or dusty environments; humidity can help. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- Keep child away from known sick contacts when possible.

## Special considerations  
- **Infants (<3 months):** Even mild symptoms warrant a doctor’s review. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **Children with chronic conditions** (asthma, heart/lung disease): monitor more closely, lower threshold to seek help. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- **Post-viral cough**: it is common for a cough to linger for 2-3 weeks after the main illness. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
