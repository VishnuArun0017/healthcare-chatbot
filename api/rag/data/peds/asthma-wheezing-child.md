## Overview / Definition
Asthma is a long-term condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and narrow, making it difficult to breathe.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma), asthma affects both children and adults but is particularly important in childhood because it can interfere with growth, sleep, and daily activities if not controlled.

Wheezing — a whistling sound during breathing — is a common sign of asthma in children, but it can also occur with viral infections or allergies. Any repeated or severe wheezing episodes should be reviewed by a healthcare professional.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
Based on [NHS Asthma in Children](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma-in-children/) and [CDC Asthma in Children](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/children.htm):
- Wheezing or whistling sound while breathing (especially at night or early morning).  
- Coughing that worsens with exercise, laughing, or crying.  
- Shortness of breath or chest tightness.  
- Trouble keeping up with peers during play.  
- Difficulty sleeping due to coughing or breathlessness.  
- Symptoms that come and go, often triggered by cold air, dust, pets, pollen, or infections.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your local emergency number (108 or 112 in India, 999 in the UK, or 911 in the US) **immediately** or go to the nearest emergency department if:
- The child is **too breathless to talk or eat**, or is struggling to breathe.  
- The child’s **lips, tongue, or face look blue** (cyanosis).  
- They are using their **tummy or neck muscles** to breathe.  
- Their **reliever inhaler (usually blue)** does not help or relief lasts only a short time.  
- The child becomes **confused, drowsy, or unresponsive**.  
- The child has a **history of severe asthma** and symptoms are rapidly worsening.

## Evidence-backed self-care
If the child is mildly wheezing or coughing but not in distress:
1. **Use the prescribed reliever inhaler (e.g., blue salbutamol inhaler)** — follow the child’s asthma action plan. ([NHS – What to Do During an Attack](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/what-to-do/))  
2. **Sit the child upright** — do not lie them down; help them stay calm and take slow breaths.  
3. **Use a spacer** with the inhaler for better medicine delivery in young children.  
4. **Monitor symptoms** — if they do not improve after 10–15 minutes or worsen, seek emergency help.  
5. **Keep track of triggers** such as pollen, smoke, or pets and avoid them. ([CDC Asthma Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/children.htm))  
6. **Continue preventive (controller) medications** as prescribed — never stop them suddenly.

## Prevention / lifestyle
Guidelines from [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma-in-children/):
- Identify and avoid **triggers** (dust, pollen, pet dander, tobacco smoke, perfumes, cold air).  
- Keep a **written asthma action plan** — discuss it with your child’s doctor or nurse.  
- **Use preventive inhalers** regularly if prescribed (even if no symptoms).  
- Ensure **flu and COVID-19 vaccinations** are up to date.  
- Encourage **regular exercise** and maintain a healthy weight to strengthen lungs.  
- Avoid exposure to **second-hand smoke** at home or in cars.  

## Special considerations
- **Infants and toddlers:** Wheezing can often occur with viral infections — persistent or repeated wheezing should always be assessed for asthma.  
- **Severe asthma:** Children needing frequent reliever inhaler use (more than three times per week) may need adjustment of long-term medication.  
- **School settings:** Ensure teachers and caregivers know where the child’s inhaler is and how to use it.  
- **Cold or humid weather:** Protect child’s airway with a scarf and avoid outdoor exercise in poor air quality.
