## Overview / Definition
Fever is a temporary rise in body temperature, often a sign that the body is fighting an infection.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/fever-in-children), a child’s body temperature is considered high when it rises above 38°C (100.4°F).  
Mild fever itself is not dangerous — it is part of the immune response — but in some cases it may signal a serious illness that needs medical care.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
From the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fever-in-children/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/childrenshealth/fever/index.html):

- Warm or hot skin, flushed face, or sweating.  
- Shivering, tiredness, or irritability.  
- Poor appetite or refusal to drink.  
- Faster breathing or heartbeat.  
- Occasional chills or muscle aches.

**Seek urgent review** if your child shows:
- High-pitched crying, persistent vomiting, or unusual drowsiness.  
- Difficulty breathing, grunting, or chest indrawing.  
- A rash that does not fade when pressed.  
- Cold hands/feet with a warm body or pale/blue lips.  
- Fits (seizures), confusion, or stiff neck.  
- Signs of dehydration — very few wet nappies, dry mouth, or sunken eyes.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your local emergency number (108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, 911 in the US) **immediately** if:
- Your child is under **3 months old** and has a temperature ≥38°C (100.4°F).  
- The fever is accompanied by **difficulty breathing, unresponsiveness, or convulsions**.  
- There is a **non-blanching rash** (does not fade when pressed).  
- There is **persistent vomiting** or inability to keep fluids down.  
- The child appears **very unwell, floppy, or unusually sleepy**.  
- Signs of **meningitis or sepsis** are present — such as mottled skin, cold extremities, or rapid breathing.

## Evidence-backed home care
According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/fever-in-children) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/childrenshealth/fever/index.html):

1. **Keep the child hydrated** – give frequent sips of water, breast milk, or oral rehydration solutions.  
2. **Light clothing and comfortable room temperature** help prevent overheating.  
3. **Monitor temperature regularly** (every 4–6 hours).  
4. **Paracetamol (acetaminophen)** or **ibuprofen** may be given for discomfort (follow dosage instructions or doctor’s advice).  
5. **Avoid cold sponging or alcohol rubs** — they can cause discomfort or harm.  
6. **Let the child rest** and ensure they are not wrapped in heavy blankets.

Never give **aspirin** to children under 16 years (risk of Reye’s syndrome).

## Prevention / lifestyle
From WHO and NHS preventive health guidance:
- Ensure **routine immunizations** (measles, influenza, COVID-19, etc.) are up to date.  
- Practice **hand hygiene** and avoid contact with sick individuals.  
- Keep children well hydrated during hot weather and illness.  
- Maintain clean surroundings to prevent vector-borne and infectious diseases.  
- Educate caregivers on **early recognition of serious illness**.

## Special considerations
- **Infants (<3 months):** Even a mild fever can signal serious infection — must always be checked by a doctor.  
- **Children with chronic illness:** Monitor more closely; fever may worsen underlying conditions.  
- **Post-vaccination fever:** Usually mild and short-lived; give fluids and rest, but seek care if it persists >48 hours.  
- **Tropical/travel areas:** Consider malaria or dengue as possible causes of fever — seek immediate evaluation.
