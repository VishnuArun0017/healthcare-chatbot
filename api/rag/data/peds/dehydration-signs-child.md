## Overview / Definition  
Dehydration occurs when a child loses more body fluid than they take in, causing the body’s fluid- and salt-balance to become disturbed.  
Children — especially infants and toddlers — are **more vulnerable** to fluid loss because of their smaller size, higher water turnover and frequent illnesses like vomiting or diarrhoea. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
Left unchecked, dehydration can lead to serious complications including seizures, kidney damage or shock. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From NHS and associated sources: :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
### Mild/moderate dehydration signs:  
- Child seems unusually thirsty or drinks more than usual.  
- Fewer wet nappies (infants) / fewer trips to pee (older child).  
- Dark-yellow, strong smelling urine or fewer wet diapers.  
- Dry mouth, lips or tongue; fewer tears when crying.  
- Sunken eyes or (for infants) sunken soft spot (fontanelle).  
- Irritability, tiredness or less active than usual.  

### Severe dehydration signs (urgent review needed):  
- Fast breathing or heartbeat. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Cold, blotchy, or pale skin; cold hands/feet. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Child is very sleepy, floppy or unresponsive.  
- Very few or no wet nappies / urine for many hours.  
- Child unable to drink or hold down fluids (especially with vomiting/diarrhoea).  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Call emergency services or take the child to hospital **immediately** if:  
- The child has severe signs above (drowsy/unresponsive, cold extremities, very fast breathing)  
- There is **no** urine output for 12 hours (infant) or child is extremely lethargic.  
- Child is under 6 months old and has any dehydration signs.  
- The child has persistent vomiting or diarrhoea, or has an underlying condition (e.g., kidney disease) that increases risk.

## Evidence-backed self-care  
While monitoring for worsening signs:  
1. Encourage **small, frequent sips** of fluids — water, or age-appropriate oral rehydration solution (ORS) if available. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
2. Continue regular feeding (breast or formula) for infants; do not dilute feeds. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
3. Offer extra fluids during hot weather, after vomiting/diarrhoea, or increased sweating. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
4. Avoid sugary soft drinks in young children as primary rehydration fluid — these may worsen diarrhoea. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
5. Monitor child’s urine output, alertness and fluid intake. If improvement does not occur within a few hours, seek medical advice.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Ensure the child **drinks regularly**, not just when feeling thirsty — in hot weather or during illness increase fluid intake. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Educate caregivers about early signs of dehydration and ensure small children always have access to fluids.  
- In illnesses causing vomiting/diarrhoea, provide fluids early and frequently.  
- Avoid overly hot environments that may accelerate fluid loss; dress child appropriately.  
- For infants, continue breastfeeding or formula feeding; do *not* reduce feed strength when fluid loss occurs.  

## Special considerations  
- **Infants (< 6 months):** Very high risk of rapid dehydration; even mild signs should prompt review.  
- **Children with chronic health conditions** (renal disease, cardiac disease, diabetes) need closer monitoring and possibly earlier intervention.  
- **Children at extremes of weather** (heatwaves or very cold) may have altered fluid needs; ensure appropriate fluid intake.  
- **After travel or in gastroenteritis outbreaks**: Always monitor for dehydration during or after vomiting/diarrhoea illnesses.
