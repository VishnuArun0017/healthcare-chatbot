## Overview / Definition  
Ear pain (or earache) in children commonly arises from infections in the ear — especially the middle ear (known as Acute Otitis Media) — or from fluid build-up behind the eardrum. According to the NHS, ear infections due to such causes are very common in children and often improve on their own.  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
Even so, ear pain should be monitored because certain signs may indicate a more serious underlying condition.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Based on NHS symptom guidance:  
- A child “pulling or rubbing their ear”, being irritable or restless, especially at night.  :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- High temperature (= fever).  :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Loss of appetite, off food, maybe poor sleep.  :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Discharge (fluid or pus) coming from the ear.  :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
These do not always mean urgent care is needed—but they *do* indicate the child needs review if pain persists or other symptoms develop.

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek urgent medical help (e.g., call your local emergency number) if any of the following occur:  
- The child has *pus or fluid discharge* from the ear.  :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Swelling or redness behind or around the ear (may signal spreading infection).  :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- The child is becoming very tired, floppy, drowsy or difficult to wake.  :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- The child has severe hearing loss or is not reacting to sounds.  :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- The child is under 12 months old and has earache in **both** ears.  :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- The child has signs of dehydration, severe headache/neck stiffness, dizziness, or breathing problems.  :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

Also seek a prompt medical review if:  
- The ear pain has lasted more than 3 days and is not improving.  :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- The child has frequent recurrent ear infections.  :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
For children with ear pain but no red flag signs:  
1. Use age-appropriate painkillers like Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for relief of pain and fever (check dosage)  :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
2. Encourage the child to drink plenty of fluids and rest.  :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
3. You may apply a warm (or cool) compress/flannel over the ear for comfort, but do *not* put objects (cotton buds, etc) into the ear canal.  :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
4. Avoid letting water or shampoo get into the affected ear.  :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
5. Monitor the child’s symptoms closely: if they worsen, or if hearing seems impaired, seek medical review.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Keep a child’s vaccinations up to date (which helps reduce some ear infections).  :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- Avoid exposing the child to passive smoke, as this increases ear-infection risk.  :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  
- Avoid inserting cotton buds or small objects into the ear canal; the ear is best left alone.  :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  
- Minimise episodes of upper respiratory infections (which often precede ear infections) by good hygiene, hand-washing, etc.

## Special considerations  
- **Infants (< 6-12 months)**: Any ear pain in this age group warrants a lower threshold for review, since complications are more likely.  :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}  
- **Children with underlying conditions** (such as immune problems, congenital heart/lung disease): Ear infections may progress more rapidly.  :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}  
- **Recurrent ear infections or fluid after infection** (glue ear) may require referral for hearing checks and further ENT review.  :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}
