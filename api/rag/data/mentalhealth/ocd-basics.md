## Overview / Definition  
Obsessive‑Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterised by **obsessions** (unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images or urges) and/or **compulsions** (repetitive behaviours or mental acts performed to reduce distress) that cause significant distress or interference with daily life.  
The NHS describes OCD as a condition “where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.” :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
According to the WHO fact sheet, OCD is a recognised condition across countries and contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From NHS “Symptoms” and NIMH resources:  
- Obsessions: unwanted, intrusive thoughts/images/impulses that repeatedly enter the mind and cause anxiety or distress. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Compulsions: repetitive behaviours or mental acts the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules. These acts may relieve anxiety temporarily but then the cycle returns. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Examples of common obsessions: fear of contamination, fear of causing harm accidentally, needing symmetry/order. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Examples of compulsions: repeated hand-washing, checking locks, ordering/arranging, mental rituals. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Impact: The thoughts/behaviours are time-consuming, cause distress, and interfere with work, home, social life. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

## Red flags & when to seek help  
Speak to your GP or a mental health professional if:  
- Obsessions or compulsions are **taking up more than 1 hour a day**, interfering with your ability to carry out daily tasks. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- You recognise the thoughts/behaviours are problematic but feel unable to control them.  
- Your routines are dominated by compulsions, or you avoid situations because of obsessive fears.  
- You experience severe anxiety, depression, or suicidal thoughts connected with OCD symptoms.  
- You have a physical or mental health condition that is being adversely affected (e.g., inability to sleep, eat, maintain hygiene).  
- Treatment so far (self-help strategies) has not improved symptoms.  

## Evidence-backed self-care & treatment basics  
According to NHS, NIMH, and WHO resources:  
- **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)** including Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the first-line psychological therapy for OCD. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Medication**: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or other treatments may be offered, often alongside CBT. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Self-help strategies**: Keeping a record of thoughts/behaviours, gradually resisting rituals, scheduling worry time, practising relaxation. (see NHS self-help guide) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Lifestyle supports**: Maintain regular sleep, exercise, balanced diet; avoid excessive caffeine/alcohol; build social support.  
- **Early intervention**: The sooner OCD is addressed, the better outcomes tend to be. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

## Prevention / lifestyle considerations  
- While OCD can’t always be prevented, managing stress, maintaining good sleep and routine, and seeking help early when new obsessive/compulsive patterns begin may reduce escalation.  
- Educate yourself and family about the condition, reduce stigma, build supportive environment.  
- If you notice patterns starting (for example: repeated “checking” rituals, intrusive thoughts you recognise but try to suppress), get an assessment rather than waiting.

## Special considerations  
- **Children and adolescents**: OCD often begins in childhood/adolescence. In children, the behaviours may seem like “funny habits” or appear to be perfectionism. If obsessive thoughts and compulsions persist >1 hour/day or interfere with school/home life, seek help. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Pregnancy and post-partum**: Some may experience new onset or worsening of OCD symptoms (for example, obsessions about harming the baby or contamination). Seek specialist perinatal services. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Comorbid conditions**: OCD often occurs alongside anxiety, depression, tic disorders or autism spectrum conditions. A comprehensive assessment is important. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
