## Overview / Definition  
Grief is the natural emotional response to loss — often the death of someone important, but also significant life-changes like losing a job, the end of a relationship, or the loss of health or home. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
Loss can affect many parts of life — thoughts, feelings, body, relationships and sense of self. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
While grief is common, how each person experiences it and how long it lasts varies — there’s no one “right” way or set time-frame. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Symptoms of grief (from the NHS and other sources) may include:  
- Shock, numbness, feeling dazed or unreality. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Intense sadness, crying, yearning. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Guilt, anger, regret—“what if”, “if only”, anger at self or others. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Anxiety, worry about the future, fear of change. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Physical symptoms: tiredness, lost appetite or comfort eating, trouble sleeping, aches. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Difficulty concentrating, remembering, engaging with life. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- For children and young people: confusion, withdrawal, acting out, fear of loss of other loved ones. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

## When to seek additional help / red flags  
Seek professional support if you notice:  
- Symptoms lasting many months without relief, or getting worse rather than gradually improving. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Persistent thoughts of self-harm, suicide, or believing life is not worth living. (Emergency)  
- Grief that severely disrupts your ability to function—work, relationships, self-care.  
- Developing very strong physical or mental health issues following the loss (e.g., major depression, panic attacks).  
- Children or adolescents showing persistent disruptive behaviour, regression, school refusal, substance misuse after a loss.  
In these cases, contact your GP, a mental-health provider, or if immediate risk, call emergency services.

## Evidence-backed self-care & coping strategies  
From Mind, NHS and NIH guidance:  
- **Talk about it**: Share your feelings with someone you trust, a friend, family member, counsellor or support group. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Create support**: Reach out to bereavement services/organisations (for example Cruse Bereavement Support in the UK). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Acknowledge your loss**: Recognise the change, name it, and allow yourself to feel—there’s no “right timeline”. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Maintain routines**: When possible, keep regular sleep, meals, gentle activity, some structure. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- **Express emotions**: Journalling, drawing, memorial rituals (lighting a candle, creating memory box) can help. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- **Self-care**: Pay attention to your body—rest, hydration, nutrition, movement. Avoid excessive alcohol/drugs as a way to cope. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Small goals**: Don’t expect to “move on” immediately. Break tasks into manageable chunks, allow yourself rest and fluctuation.  
- **Remember the person/loss**: Find meaningful ways to honour or remember, not erase, what has been lost. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
While grief cannot always be prevented, some actions can support healthier coping:  
- Build and maintain strong social connections and community ties.  
- Know in advance (if possible) how you might respond to loss—having supports, rituals, awareness helps.  
- Cultivate resilience: regular physical activity, sleep, managing stress, good nutrition.  
- For people anticipating loss (e.g., caring for a dying loved one) try to access anticipatory grief support.  

## Special considerations  
- **Children & adolescents:** Loss may manifest differently—regression, acting out, physical complaints, etc. Provide age-appropriate explanation, encourage expression, involve in memorials. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- **Older adults:** May face multiple losses (partner, friends, health) and risk isolation; need intentional social connection and monitoring of mental health. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- **Loss other than death:** Loss of job, home, health, relationships, identity can cause grief too and warrant similar support. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  
- **Complicated grief / prolonged grief disorder:** When grief stays very intense, prevents functioning for 6+ months, involves intense longing, inability to accept the loss — professional help becomes important. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
