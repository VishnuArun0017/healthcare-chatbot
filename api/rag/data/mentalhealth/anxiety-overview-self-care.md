## Overview / Definition  
Anxiety is a normal human emotion—fear, worry, tension. But when it becomes excessive, persistent, or starts interfering with daily life, it may be an anxiety disorder. According to the World Health Organization, anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders worldwide. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
The National Health Service (UK) notes that anxiety isn’t just “feeling stressed” — it can manifest physically and require action. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Signs you might be dealing with more than occasional nerves:  
- Persistent, excessive worry or fear about everyday events.  
- Restlessness, feeling “on edge”, difficulty relaxing.  
- Physical symptoms: racing heart, sweating, trembling, gastrointestinal upset.  
- Avoidance of situations because of fear or anxiety.  
- Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.  
- Trouble sleeping (falling or staying asleep).  
The NHS self-help guide explains that these symptoms may be mild or moderate but *persistent*. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
These are practical steps you can do if your anxiety is manageable and you’re looking to control it:  
1. **Breathe and ground yourself** – deep breaths, focus shifting, use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique if you’re feeling overwhelmed. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
2. **Stay active** – regular movement helps reduce anxiety symptoms. Even a short walk counts. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
3. **Recognise and challenge your thoughts** – ask yourself if the worry is realistic, if you’re jumping to conclusions. Look at what you can control. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
4. **Sleep and nutrition matter** – aim for decent rest, maintain a balanced diet, limit caffeine/alcohol.  
5. **Use healthy routines** – set everyday small rituals: morning check-in, short breaks, work/personal boundaries.  
6. **Talk it out** – share with friends/family or a professional. You don’t have to go through anxiety alone. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Build a daily “mental health toolkit” — something you do each day just for you (hobby, nature, reading).  
- Notice early signs of anxiety and act early, rather than letting it build.  
- Limit exposure to triggers where possible (news overload, toxic interactions).  
- Strengthen support systems — friends, community, mentors — they help buffer anxiety.  
- If you’ve had anxiety episodes before, a little extra vigilance pays off.

## Special considerations  
- **Work or study pressure**: If deadlines, change, or performance anxiety are triggers, build in micro-breaks, realistic goals, and de-stress habits.  
- **Physical health overlap**: Conditions like thyroid disorders, heart issues, caffeine overuse can mimic or aggravate anxiety — get a check-up if new symptoms appear.  
- **Youth/teens**: Anxiety often starts early; help them with routines, talk-time, and recognising what they feel.  
- **Chronic or long-term anxiety**: If you’re experiencing persistent anxiety despite self-care, you may need structured therapy (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy) and professional support. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
