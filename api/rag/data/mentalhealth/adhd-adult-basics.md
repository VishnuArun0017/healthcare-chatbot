## Overview / Definition  
Attention‑Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by patterns of **inattention**, **hyperactivity** and/or **impulsivity** that begin in childhood and can persist into adulthood. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
In adults, symptoms may change in presentation — hyperactivity may become internal restlessness rather than overt movement, and inattention may impact work or relationships. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
Adults with ADHD may face challenges in organising tasks, meeting deadlines, managing responsibilities, maintaining focus, and regulating impulsive behaviours. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
According to NHS Inform and other sources, symptoms in adults may include:  
- Difficulty sustaining attention, being easily distracted, missing details. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Trouble organising tasks, managing time, finishing projects. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Restlessness, an inner sense of being driven, fidgeting, or difficulty relaxing. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Impulsivity: acting without thinking, interrupting, making decisions quickly, risky behaviours. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Emotional dysregulation: irritability, frustration, low tolerance for stress. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- A longstanding history of these symptoms (often since childhood) affecting more than one area of life (work, home, social). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

## Red flags & when to seek help  
Consider seeking a professional assessment if:  
- Symptoms are interfering significantly with work performance, relationships, home responsibilities.  
- You recognise a pattern of lifelong difficulties, not just recent stress, and suspect ADHD.  
- You have high levels of distractibility, impulsivity, disorganisation, and coping strategies are failing.  
- You also experience comorbid issues such as mood disorders, anxiety, substance misuse, which frequently occur alongside adult ADHD. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- You’re struggling to manage daily tasks, deadlines, finances, or interpersonal relationships because of these challenges.

## Evidence-backed self-care & treatment basics  
From clinical guidelines and resources:  
- **Assessment & diagnosis**: A full specialist assessment is needed for adult ADHD, often involving history of childhood symptoms, current functioning, and comorbidities. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Medication**: Often includes stimulant or non-stimulant ADHD medications under supervision.  
- **Psychological therapies**: For example cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) adapted for ADHD, skills training (time management, organisation).  
- **Lifestyle supports & strategies**:  
  - Structure your day: to-do lists, timers, chunking tasks.  
  - Manage distractions: minimise multi-tasking, create organised environment.  
  - Build routines: sleep hygiene, regular exercise, healthy diet.  
  - Use external reminders and tools (apps, calendars).  
- **Comorbidity management**: Address co-occurring depression, anxiety or substance use as these impact ADHD outcomes.

## Prevention / lifestyle considerations  
While the condition itself may not be entirely preventable, these actions help optimise outcomes:  
- Early recognition: If suspected, getting support early improves functioning.  
- Educate yourself and your support network (family, workplace) about ADHD.  
- Adjust work and home environments to accommodate challenges: breaks, structured tasks, reminders.  
- Monitor lifestyle factors: good sleep, exercise, avoiding excessive alcohol or substances that worsen symptoms.

## Special considerations  
- **Adults diagnosed later in life**: Many adults discover they have ADHD only in adulthood; the way symptoms present may differ and often include more subtle difficulties.  
- **Comorbid conditions**: High rates of mood disorders, addiction, anxiety in adults with ADHD — assessment must consider these. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- **Workplace implications**: ADHD can impact occupational functioning; reasonable accommodations may support productivity.  
- **Women**: ADHD in women may be under-recognised, especially if inattentive symptoms predominate.  
- **Transitioning from childhood services**: Adults diagnosed in childhood should have continuing support; services for adult ADHD are variable. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
