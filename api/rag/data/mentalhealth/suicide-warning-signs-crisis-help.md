## Overview / Definition  
Suicide refers to ending one’s own life intentionally. According to the WHO, more than 700,000 people die by suicide every year, and many more attempt it. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
While suicidal behaviour is complex and shaped by multiple interacting factors, there are often warning signs that someone is considering it. Recognising these signs early can save lives. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Common warning signs  
According to the NIMH and the NHS, warning signs may include:  
- Talking or writing about wanting to die, killing oneself, or saying things like “There’s no way out”. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Feeling hopeless, trapped, or like a burden to others. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Big mood swings: extremely sad, anxious, agitated, or a sudden calm after a period of depression. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Increased use of alcohol or drugs, or risky/impulsive behaviour. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Withdrawing from friends, family, activities. Changes in sleep or appetite. Giving things away. Making a will or saying goodbye. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Accessing means of self-harm: obtaining pills, weapons, or other methods. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

## Red flags & when to seek immediate help  
If you notice any of the following, treat this as an **emergency**:  
- The person has a clear plan for how they would take their life and access to lethal means (pills, weapons, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- They express intent to act on suicidal thoughts soon.  
- They withdraw completely, stop responding, or seem resigned to death.  
- You believe they may act on their thoughts if left alone.  
- They are under the influence of alcohol/drugs and expressing suicidal thoughts.  
- Someone has just made a suicide attempt.  

In such situations, do **not** leave the person alone — remove means of self-harm if safe, stay with them, call your local emergency number, or escort them to the nearest emergency department.

## Evidence-backed next steps  
If warning signs are present, consider the following steps:  
1. **Ask directly**: “Are you thinking of ending your life?” Asking does *not* increase risk, and can open the way to help.  
2. **Stay with the person** if immediate risk is present, or ensure safe supervision until help arrives.  
3. **Remove or lock away instruments** of self-harm (medications, sharp objects, firearms) if possible.  
4. **Encourage professional support**: contact a mental-health crisis team, GP, or call an urgent helpline.  
5. **Create a safety plan**: includes warning signs, internal coping strategies, contacts, professional help, and safe environment. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

## Prevention / protective factors  
Based on WHO and CDC risk-factor frameworks:  
- Strong personal connection: family, friends, community support. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Access to mental-health services and timely treatment of depression, substance use, chronic illness.  
- Reducing access to means of suicide (e.g., safe storage of medications, firearms). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- Promoting life-skills, problem-solving, emotional resilience.  
- Encouraging help-seeking behaviour and reducing stigma around mental illness.

## Special considerations  
- **Young people/teens**: Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents & young adults. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **Older adults**: Isolation, chronic pain/illness, bereavement increase risk.  
- **People with chronic/severe physical illness**: Chronic pain or disability heightens risk. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- **LGBTQ+ individuals**: Elevated risk due to discrimination, identity stress, isolation.  
- **Previous attempt survivors**: History of attempt strongly raises future risk.
