## Overview / Definition  
Substance use becomes problematic when it leads to harmful consequences for a person’s health, relationships, or responsibilities, yet the use continues despite those harms. According to NIDA, addiction (substance use disorder) is a chronic relapsing disorder characterised by compulsive substance use despite negative outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasises that misuse of substances like opioids, alcohol or other drugs can lead to overdose, serious health damage, and death. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
The National Health Service (UK) describes addiction as “not having control over doing, taking or using something to the point where it could be harmful to you”. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Common signs / warning flags  
Warnings that substance use may be escalating into a harmful pattern include:

- Turning to the substance more frequently or in larger amounts than intended. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- A growing inability to cut down or stop using, even if you want to. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Spending a lot of time obtaining, using or recovering from the substance. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Neglecting work, school or home responsibilities because of substance use. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Continuing to use despite social, legal or health problems caused or worsened by the substance. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Developing greater tolerance (needing more to get the same effect) and/or withdrawal symptoms when the substance is stopped. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Recognising strong cravings or urges for the substance. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Significant changes in behaviour, mood, friend group, or activity patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Look for these high-risk signs that demand urgent professional help:

- Using a substance in a way that risks overdose, poisoning, or major harm (e.g., injection use, mixing depressants, using alone). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Repeated overdoses or very near-miss events.  
- Severe withdrawal symptoms (seizures, delirium tremens in alcohol withdrawal).  
- Substance use in pregnancy or by someone with major medical comorbidity (heart disease, liver failure, etc.).  
- Suicidal thoughts or actions while under influence or during withdrawal.  
- Severe impairment in daily functioning: unable to work, care for home/family, or stay safe.  
- Seeking help but unable to stay abstinent, or multiple failed attempts at reduction.  
- Legal or forensic crisis related to substance use (e.g., driving under influence, major accident).  

## Evidence-backed next steps  
When you recognise warning signs, the following steps are supported by evidence:

1. **Seek professional assessment** — contact a primary care doctor, addiction specialist, or certified counsellor.  
2. **Use harm-reduction measures** — if complete abstinence is not immediately feasible, reduce risk: avoid using alone, test substances, carry overdose reversal (e.g., naloxone) if opioids involved. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
3. **Access structured treatment** — depending on severity, this may include medication-assisted therapy (e.g., for opioids), behavioural therapies, peer groups. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
4. **Support network** — family, friends, recovery groups play a key role; isolation increases risk of relapse or overdose.  
5. **Follow-up and monitoring** — because substance use disorders tend to be chronic, long-term support and monitoring improve outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Educate about risk, especially at younger ages (most use begins in adolescence). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- Maintain stable routines, healthy coping mechanisms for stress, and strong social supports.  
- Avoid environments/triggers associated with substance use; build alternative rewarding activities.  
- Review prescription medications with your doctor; avoid mixing or misusing prescribed drugs.  
- Stay informed about overdose signs and keep emergency contacts accessible.

## Special considerations  
- **Adolescents & young adults:** Rapid changes in behaviour may signal substance use; early intervention is critical. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **Polysubstance use:** Use of more than one substance (e.g., alcohol + opioids) heightens risk of severe outcomes.  
- **Pregnancy:** Any substance use during pregnancy poses risks to mother and fetus—seek specialist help.  
- **Chronic illness & mental health:** Substance use often co-exists with mental health issues; integrated care is advised.  
- **Overdose risk:** For opioid use in particular, carrying naloxone and being familiar with overdose signs is lifesaving. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
