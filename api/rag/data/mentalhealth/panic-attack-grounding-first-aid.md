## Overview / Definition  
A panic attack is a sudden surge of overwhelming fear or discomfort, often with intense physical symptoms and typically peaking within minutes. According to NHS, it can feel very frightening though is **not usually life-threatening**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
Consider it a “false alarm” of the body’s survival response: strong, scary, and urgent—but often harmless in itself.

## Common signs / warning symptoms  
When a panic attack starts, some of these may appear:  
- Rapid, pounding heart or palpitations. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Shortness of breath, feeling like you’re choking or suffocating. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Trembling or shaking; sweating or chills. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Chest pain or discomfort (often mistaken for a heart attack). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Feeling detached from yourself or reality (“derealisation” or “depersonalisation”). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Numbness or tingling sensations. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Intensely afraid of losing control, “going crazy”, or dying. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

## What you can do (grounding & first aid)  
When a panic attack hits (either for yourself or someone else), try these steps:  
1. **Stay still (if safe)** — Sit or lean back, avoid rushing or escaping impulsively.  
2. **Breathe slowly** — Inhale for 4-5 seconds, exhale for 4-5 seconds. Focus on a hand on your belly expanding & contracting. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
3. **Remind yourself/other** that it's scary but it will pass. You’re safe. It’s not destroying your body. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
4. **Ground your senses** — Pick a sensory anchor (e.g., chewing mint gum; feel the texture of something; stamp feet). Helps shift focus. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
5. **Stay with the person (if helping someone)** — Speak slow, calm, short sentences. Offer water (non-caffeinated). Remove startling stimuli. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
6. After the acute phase, **allow recovery time** — rest, hydrate, take it easy for a bit to avoid rebound anxiety.

## When to seek professional help  
Contact a GP or mental-health professional if:  
- Panic attacks are frequent, untriggered, or causing avoidance of life-areas. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- You’re having panic symptoms for the first time and you’re unsure if it could be a physical issue (heart, thyroid, etc).  
- Thoughts of self-harm, suicide, or you feel you can’t cope or escape panic safely.  
- Panic attacks are linked to drug/alcohol use, or agoraphobia (avoidance of places).  

## Prevention / lifestyle support  
- Practice regular relaxation techniques (deep-breathing, mindfulness, gentle exercise).  
- Limit caffeine, stimulants, and excessive alcohol—they can worsen panic. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Build confidence: learn what helps during an attack and rehearse it mentally.  
- Keep a trigger-journal: note when attacks happen, what preceded them, and use that to spot patterns.  
- Stay connected: talk with friends/family, don’t isolate. Panic often feeds on isolation and rumination.

## Special considerations  
- **Young people / students**: Panic may show up as school avoidance, drop in performance, or fear of leaving home. Early support helps.  
- **Physical illness**: Conditions like asthma, hyperthyroid, or heart issues can mimic or trigger panic attacks. Rule these out.  
- **Work or public settings**: If panic happens at work or out, plan ahead: carry water, know safe space, use breathing strategies before panic builds.  
- **Acute episode mistaken for heart attack**: If chest pain persists, or you have risk factors, treat it as emergency until ruled out.
