## Overview / Definition  
Stress is your body’s natural reaction to pressure — from life events, work, relationships, changes. While short bursts of stress are normal, long-lasting or unmanaged stress can hurt your health.  
The World Health Organization provides easy-to-use strategies built around daily skills. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Recognised by the NHS: :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Feeling overwhelmed, unable to cope or control normal tasks.  
- Physical signs: pounding heart, dry mouth, headaches, loss of appetite.  
- Emotional signs: irritability, anxiety, being easily upset or tearful.  
- Behavioural change: avoiding people or tasks, sleeping badly, using alcohol or drugs.  
If you notice these persistently, it's time to act.

## Evidence-backed self-care  
Here are practical steps you can start *today*:  
- **Breathe and pause**: Take a few deep breaths, allow yourself 2-3 minutes to calm down before reacting. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Be active**: Regular movement helps reduce stress intensity. Walk, stretch, dance. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Connect with people**: Talk to friends/family. Social support reduces stress. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Have “me-time”**: Do something you enjoy—reading, music, hobby, nature. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Avoid unhealthy coping**: Alcohol, caffeine, smoking, overdoing work — these make stress worse. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Accept what you can’t change**: Focus energy on what you can control. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Track triggers**: Keep a simple diary of when you feel stressed, what was happening and how you reacted. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Make a plan: schedule rest, exercise and hobbies as part of daily routine.  
- Prioritize sleep and nutrition — your brain and body need good fuel. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Practice mindfulness or relaxation: being present helps ease the pressure. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Build resilience: regular self-care = you’re stronger when stress hits.  

## Special considerations  
- **Work-related stress**: At work? Learn to say no, take breaks, talk to manager. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- **Chronic illness or major life change**: Stress may look different — fatigue, withdrawal — get support early.  
- **Students/young adults**: Deadlines, change, social pressure matter — same tools apply.  
- **Children/teens**: May show stress via behavioural changes, sleep issues; help them with routine, open talk.
