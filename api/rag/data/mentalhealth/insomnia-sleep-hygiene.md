## Overview / Definition
**Insomnia** is difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking too early and being unable to fall back asleep — even when you have the chance to rest.  
According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/), short-term insomnia (lasting days or weeks) is often linked to stress or life changes, while long-term insomnia (lasting months) may signal an underlying health or mental condition.  
The [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sleep-and-health) highlights that quality sleep is essential for immune function, emotional stability, and brain performance.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
From the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/) and [CDC Sleep Hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html):  
- Difficulty falling asleep despite being tired.  
- Waking up frequently during the night.  
- Waking too early and not feeling rested.  
- Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or irritability.  
- Trouble concentrating, memory issues, or low mood.  
- Worrying about sleep, making the problem worse.

If insomnia lasts more than a few weeks or affects daily life, medical advice is recommended.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Seek professional help from a doctor or mental health provider if:  
- You have insomnia lasting longer than **4 weeks** despite lifestyle changes ([NHS Insomnia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/)).  
- Poor sleep is linked with **severe stress, anxiety, or depression**.  
- You regularly fall asleep during activities such as driving or working (possible sleep disorder like sleep apnea).  
- You use alcohol or sleep medications frequently to fall asleep.  
- Sudden, unexplained insomnia occurs with **chest pain, shortness of breath, or new physical symptoms** — these may need urgent review.

## Evidence-backed self-care (Sleep Hygiene)
Healthy sleep habits — or *sleep hygiene* — are recommended by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/self-help/):

1. **Keep a consistent schedule** — go to bed and wake up at the same time daily, even on weekends.  
2. **Limit caffeine and nicotine** after mid-afternoon.  
3. **Avoid screens** (phones, laptops, TV) at least 30–60 minutes before bed.  
4. **Keep your room dark, quiet, and cool** — ideal temperature: 18–20 °C.  
5. **Use your bed only for sleep and intimacy** — avoid working or eating in bed.  
6. **Avoid heavy meals and alcohol** close to bedtime.  
7. **Relax before bed** — try deep breathing, meditation, or gentle stretching.  
8. **Get regular exercise** (but not right before bed).  
9. **If awake more than 20 minutes**, get out of bed, do something calm (like reading), then return once sleepy.

## Prevention / lifestyle
Based on [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sleep-and-health) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html):  
- Maintain a balanced daily routine — sunlight exposure during the day supports healthy circadian rhythms.  
- Limit naps to under 30 minutes.  
- Avoid overthinking sleep — focus on relaxation instead.  
- Manage stress with yoga, journaling, or talking to supportive people.  
- Review medications with your doctor — some can disrupt sleep cycles.  

## Special considerations
- **Children and teens:** Encourage consistent bedtime routines and limit screen use.  
- **Shift workers:** Use blackout curtains, eye masks, and consistent rest schedules.  
- **Pregnancy:** Hormonal and physical changes can disrupt sleep — short naps and supportive pillows can help.  
- **Older adults:** Lighter sleep is common with age; avoid sedatives without supervision.
