## Overview / Definition
Depression is a common mental disorder that causes persistent sadness, loss of interest, and reduced energy.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression), it is distinct from usual mood fluctuations and temporary emotional responses to life’s challenges.  
It can affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities such as sleeping, eating, or working.

The [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/clinical-depression/overview/) defines depression as “more than feeling unhappy for a few days.” It becomes a medical condition when the symptoms last weeks or months and interfere with normal life.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
From [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression), [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/clinical-depression/overview/), and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/learn/depression.htm):
- Persistent sadness or low mood lasting more than two weeks.  
- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed.  
- Fatigue or loss of energy.  
- Sleep disturbances — insomnia or excessive sleep.  
- Changes in appetite or weight (loss or gain).  
- Difficulty concentrating, indecisiveness, or slowed thinking.  
- Feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness.  
- Thoughts of self-harm, death, or suicide.  

Not everyone experiences all these symptoms, and their intensity can vary. Even mild symptoms can become serious if untreated.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Seek **urgent professional help** or contact your local crisis helpline if you experience any of the following (based on NHS and WHO guidelines):
- Thoughts of self-harm, suicide, or that life is not worth living.  
- Inability to carry out daily tasks (e.g., eating, working, or getting out of bed).  
- Feeling persistently hopeless or emotionally numb.  
- Rapid worsening of symptoms despite self-care.  
- Severe withdrawal from family, friends, or social contact.  
- Feeling out of touch with reality (hallucinations or delusions).  
- Uncontrolled use of alcohol or drugs to cope with feelings.  

In the UK, call **999** or go to **A&E** if you feel you may harm yourself. In India, you can reach out to **AASRA (91-9820466726)** or **Snehi (91-9582208181)**.  
If outside these areas, contact your local emergency number or national mental health helpline.

## Evidence-backed self-care
For mild symptoms, [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/) suggest early, structured self-help steps:
1. **Stay connected** – talk to friends, family, or support groups even if it feels difficult.  
2. **Keep a simple routine** – consistent wake/sleep times, meals, and short daily goals.  
3. **Move regularly** – light exercise like walking can improve mood and energy.  
4. **Eat nourishing food** – regular meals, balanced nutrition, and hydration support recovery.  
5. **Limit alcohol and stimulants** – they can worsen mood and disrupt sleep.  
6. **Practice calm habits** – breathing, journaling, or mindfulness activities help regulate emotions.  
7. **Avoid isolation** – even small social contact can ease the sense of disconnection.  

If symptoms persist beyond two weeks or worsen, seek evaluation from a healthcare provider or mental health specialist.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Manage stress with healthy coping techniques — meditation, time outdoors, or creative hobbies.  
- Maintain regular sleep hygiene and physical activity.  
- Seek support early if mood changes persist; early treatment prevents severe episodes.  
- Reduce screen time and information overload, especially before bed.  
- Create a safe emotional environment — stay close to supportive people.  

## Special considerations
- **Children and teens:** Depression may appear as irritability, poor performance, or withdrawal rather than sadness.  
- **Older adults:** Often underdiagnosed; look for fatigue, sleep issues, or loss of interest in normal activities.  
- **Pregnancy & postpartum:** Depression can occur during or after pregnancy and requires timely professional support.  
- **Chronic illness:** Depression commonly coexists with long-term physical conditions — regular check-ins are important.
