## Overview / Definition
**Travel health** focuses on keeping travellers safe from illness or injury before, during, and after trips.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/travel-health), it includes vaccines, food and water safety, protection against mosquitoes and infections, and managing chronic conditions while abroad.  

Good travel health means *planning ahead* — understanding potential health risks of your destination and knowing how to respond if something goes wrong.

## Common travel health risks
Based on [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/travel-health) and [CDC Travelers’ Health](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel):
- **Food and waterborne illnesses** – e.g., traveler’s diarrhea, cholera, typhoid.  
- **Mosquito-borne diseases** – malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika virus.  
- **Respiratory infections** – including COVID-19, influenza, and tuberculosis.  
- **Injuries and accidents** – especially road accidents or unsafe recreational activities.  
- **Sunburn, heat exhaustion, or dehydration** in hot climates.  
- **Jet lag, fatigue, and sleep disturbances** from long-distance travel.  

## Red flags & when to escalate
Seek **urgent medical care** or contact emergency services if, during or after travel, you experience:
- Persistent fever (possible malaria or other infection).  
- Severe vomiting or diarrhea leading to dehydration.  
- Jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes) or dark urine.  
- Unexplained rash with fever.  
- Shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe cough.  
- Confusion, headache, or neck stiffness.  
- Bleeding from gums, nose, or under skin (possible dengue or viral hemorrhagic fever).  

If symptoms occur *after* returning home, tell your doctor exactly where you travelled and for how long — some infections appear weeks later.

## Evidence-backed self-care
As per [NHS Travel Health](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/travel-health/) and [CDC guidance](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travelers-tips):
1. **See a travel clinic 4–6 weeks before departure** for vaccines and preventive medication (e.g., malaria prophylaxis).  
2. **Pack a travel health kit** – with your regular meds, antiseptics, rehydration salts, insect repellent, sunscreen, and basic first aid.  
3. **Stay hydrated** and avoid unsafe street food or untreated water.  
4. **Practice hand hygiene** frequently, especially before eating.  
5. **Avoid mosquito bites** – wear long sleeves, use repellents with DEET, and sleep under nets if in tropical areas.  
6. **Carry travel insurance** that covers medical emergencies and evacuation.  
7. **Be cautious with adventure activities** (e.g., diving, hiking) – use reputable operators and safety gear.  

## Prevention / lifestyle
Following [WHO Travel Health](https://www.who.int/health-topics/travel-health) and [CDC pre-travel advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/preparing-for-travel):
- Stay updated on required and recommended **vaccinations**.  
- Check for **travel advisories** and disease outbreaks before your trip.  
- **Avoid animal bites** and do not handle stray animals (risk of rabies).  
- Use **safe transportation** and wear seatbelts or helmets.  
- Plan for **jet lag** by adjusting your sleep schedule before long flights.  
- Maintain **mental wellbeing** — travel stress can worsen anxiety or chronic illness.  

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Ensure vaccinations are up to date; keep oral rehydration solutions handy.  
- **Pregnancy:** Avoid destinations with Zika or malaria; consult your doctor before travel.  
- **Elderly or chronically ill travellers:** Carry extra medication, a summary of medical history, and doctor’s contact details.  
- **Immunocompromised travellers:** May need extra protection or to avoid certain destinations.
