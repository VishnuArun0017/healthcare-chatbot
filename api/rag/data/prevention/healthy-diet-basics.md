## Overview / Definition  
A healthy diet means eating a variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to maintain good health, support growth and development, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.  
According to the WHO: consuming a healthy diet across the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
The UK NHS emphasises that healthy eating means balancing energy intake (calories) with the amount of physical activity, and choosing foods that provide a wide range of nutrients. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

## Key components / what to include  
Some of the important elements of a healthy diet (based on WHO & NHS) include:  
- Plenty of **fruit and vegetables** — at least 5 portions of a variety each day (WHO recommends at least 400 g/day). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Base meals on **higher-fibre starchy carbohydrates** (wholegrain where possible) like potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, cereals. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Include **lean proteins**: such as beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat, or dairy alternatives. The NHS suggests eating more fish, including one portion of oily fish each week. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Choose **unsaturated fats** (e.g., vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, fish) rather than saturated fats and avoid trans-fats. WHO: saturated fats <10% of total energy intake; trans-fats <1%. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Limit **free sugars** to less than 10% of total energy intake (and ideally <5% for extra benefit). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Keep salt (sodium) intake low — less than 5 g salt (≈2g sodium) per day for adults, to reduce risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

## Practical tips / “How to eat well”  
From the UK NHS (8 tips) and other sources:  
- Base meals on starchy carbohydrate foods; aim for wholegrain or higher-fibre versions. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables—aim for a variety and try to reach the “5 A Day”. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Eat more fish, including one portion of oily fish each week. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Cut down on foods high in saturated fat, sugar and salt. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Keep an eye on portion sizes and total calories: eating more energy than you use leads to weight gain. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Plan ahead: shop smart, cook more meals at home, choose healthier snacks. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- Read food labels: check for hidden sugars, salt, saturated fats. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Stay hydrated and choose water, lower-fat milk or unsweetened drinks rather than sugary drinks. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  

## Life-course / special groups  
- For children and young people: Eating habits early in life help establish long-term health. The WHO emphasises healthy diet from infancy. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- For older adults: Nutrient-rich diets become even more important as appetite and absorption may change.  
- For people with chronic conditions: A healthy diet is especially important to prevent complications (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity).  
- Cultural and local food practices matter: A healthy diet should fit within local cultural context, available foods and individual lifestyle. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  

## Why it matters / benefits  
- A healthy diet helps maintain a healthy body weight, balance energy intake and output, and reduce the risk of many chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- It helps ensure adequate intake of vitamins, minerals, fibre and other essential nutrients.  
- It supports overall health, vitality and wellbeing—giving more energy, better mood, better sleep and improved recovery.
