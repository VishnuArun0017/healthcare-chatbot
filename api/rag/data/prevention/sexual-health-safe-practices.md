## Overview / Definition  
Sexual health means a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is **not** just the absence of disease or dysfunction. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
A safe and healthy sex life involves positive and respectful attitudes to sexuality and relationships, consent, pleasure, freedom from coercion, discrimination and violence. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
“Safe practices” in sexual health are behaviours and choices that protect individuals and their partners from unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), emotional harm and other risks.

## Key safe practice components  
From WHO, NHS and CDC guidance:  
- Use **barrier contraception** (e.g., condoms, internal/female condoms) consistently and correctly — the only method that protects against most STIs as well as pregnancy. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Engage in **mutual consent and open communication** with your partner(s) about health status, STI testing, contraception, boundaries and expectations. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Get **vaccinated** where appropriate (e.g., for HPV, hepatitis B) to reduce STI risk. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Limit number of sexual partners** and avoid overlapping sexual partnerships when possible — this reduces STI transmission chains. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Avoid or minimise sexual activities when judgement is impaired (e.g., due to alcohol, drugs) to reduce risk of regret, non-consensual acts or unsafe sex. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- For non-penetrative sexual activities, maintain hygiene, use protection where needed, and avoid contact if there are sores/cuts. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

## When to seek professional support  
Seek specialist or medical advice if:  
- You or your partner test positive for an STI; need partner notification and treatment.  
- You experience unexpected symptoms: unusual discharge, genital sores, pelvic pain, fever after sex.  
- You or your partner want advice on contraception, fertility planning, or transitioning sexual practices safely.  
- You’ve had unprotected sex and are unsure of STI risk or face unintended pregnancy.  
- You feel pressured or coerced into sexual activity — this may involve legal/social support.  

## Prevention / lifestyle & relationship health  
- Practice regular STI testing as recommended for your age/behaviour.  
- Keep emergency contraception accessible or know where to get it.  
- Foster respectful relationships: equality, consent, awareness of power dynamics.  
- Talk openly with partner(s) about sexual health, boundaries and pleasure.  
- Seek trustworthy information — avoid relying solely on pornography or social-media as sex education sources.  
- In long-term relationships: re-discuss sexual history, testing, contraception, changes in health.  

## Special considerations  
- **Young people**: Need age-appropriate education, access to condoms/contraception, safe non-judgemental services.  
- **Pregnancy & postpartum**: Changes in sexual health, need for tailored contraception/recovery advice.  
- **LGBTQ+ couples**: Safe practices apply; some activities carry different risks.  
- **People with disabilities or chronic conditions**: May need tailored advice for safe, satisfying, and inclusive sexual health.  
- **Travel / high-risk settings**: Extra caution required (e.g., condoms, STI awareness, alcohol/drugs awareness). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
