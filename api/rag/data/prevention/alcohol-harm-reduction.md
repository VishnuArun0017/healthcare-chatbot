## Overview / Definition  
“Alcohol harm reduction” refers to practical strategies aimed at reducing the negative health, social and personal consequences of alcohol use — whether or not abstinence is the goal.  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), harmful use of alcohol causes some **3 million deaths every year**, and contributes heavily to disease, injury and social burden. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## Why it matters / risks of alcohol use  
Per NHS guidance:  
- Men and women are recommended **not to regularly exceed 14 units per week** to keep risk of harm low. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Short-term risks: accidents, injuries, unprotected sex, poisoning. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Long-term risks: cardiovascular disease, liver disease, cancer, brain damage. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Key harm-reduction strategies  
Here are practical ways to reduce alcohol-related harm:  
- **Set limits**: Decide how many units you’ll drink in a session or week, and stick to it. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Count drinks / use units**: Be aware of standard units and how much you consume. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Have alcohol-free days each week**: Helps reduce overall consumption and gives body time to recover. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Avoid high-risk drinking patterns**: Bingeing, drinking on empty stomach, mixing drinks, may greatly increase harm. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Improve safety of drinking context**: Eat food while drinking, drink water between alcoholic drinks, avoid driving or risky activities when drinking. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Seek professional help if needed**: If you’re dependent (withdrawal symptoms, loss of control), you may need specialist support. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

## Special considerations  
- **Pregnancy / trying to conceive**: Even low amounts may increase risk to baby—best to avoid drinking. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Younger people & developing brains**: Alcohol may interrupt development and increase risk of dependence.  
- **Older adults**: More vulnerable to alcohol’s effects due to medication interactions, slower metabolism.  
- **When withdrawal symptoms occur**: If you get shaking, sweating, nausea when not drinking — do **not** stop cold turkey without medical advice. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

## When to seek help  
- If you drink more than the recommended levels regularly.  
- If you are unable to reduce or stop despite wanting to.  
- If you experience withdrawal symptoms (seizures, confusion).  
- If alcohol use is causing relationship, work, legal or financial problems.  

## Prevention & lifestyle  
- Develop alternative coping strategies: physical activity, hobbies, socialising without alcohol.  
- Supportive environment: friends/family who respect your decision to drink less or abstain.  
- Public policy measures (for societies) also help: pricing, marketing restrictions, availability. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
