## Overview / Definition  
Physical activity means any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. According to the WHO, this includes movement during work, transport, household chores, recreation, exercise or sport. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
Regular appropriate physical activity is a key factor in maintaining physical health, mental health, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
In simple terms: moving more and sitting less is one of the best things you can do for your health.

## Recommended activity levels  
### Adults (≈ 19–64 years)  
- Aim for at least **150 minutes** of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, or **75 minutes** of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Include **muscle-strengthening activities** on 2 or more days per week (major muscle groups: legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Spread activity through the week, reduce long periods of sedentary time (sitting) by breaking them up with movement. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

### Children & Young People (≈ 5–18 years)  
- Aim for an average of at least **60 minutes per day** of moderate-to-vigorous activity across the week. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Include a variety of intensities, muscle- and bone-strengthening activities.  

### Older Adults (65 + years)  
- Same aerobic targets as adults (150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity) if able. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Include activities that improve **balance** and **strength** on 2 or more days per week to reduce risk of falls.  

## Why it matters / Benefits  
- Helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, many cancers, obesity and dementia. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Improves mental health: lowers anxiety, depression symptoms, improves mood and cognitive function.  
- Enhances muscle strength, bone health, mobility and functional ability especially as we age.  
- Supports healthy weight maintenance, better sleep, and improved quality of life.

## Practical tips / getting started  
- Choose activities you enjoy (walking, cycling, dancing, swimming, sports) so you stick with them.  
- Break activity into smaller chunks: e.g., 10–15 minutes at a time is still beneficial. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Strength training can be body-weight exercises, resistance bands, weights or heavy gardening/shovelling.  
- Reduce sedentary time: stand up, stretch, walk for a few minutes every hour.  
- Set realistic, gradual goals and increase intensity or time as you build fitness.  
- Combine aerobic + strength + balance (especially for older adults).  

## Special considerations  
- If you have a chronic condition (heart disease, arthritis, diabetes), consult your doctor/physio to tailor activity safely.  
- For pregnancy/post-partum: physical activity is beneficial when approved by your doctor; strength and balance components adjusted accordingly.  
- Children with disabilities: activity levels adapted to ability, any amount better than none. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Avoid long stretches of sitting; even light activity is better than none.
