## Overview / Definition  
Proper hand hygiene and mask use are key preventive measures against respiratory infections and many other communicable diseases.  
– Hand hygiene means cleaning your hands either by washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand-rub when appropriate. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
– Mask use refers to wearing a face covering (cloth mask, medical mask or respirator depending on context) appropriately to reduce transmission of airborne or droplet infections. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
Together, they help reduce the spread of germs **to** you and **from** you.

## When to Use Hand Hygiene & Masks  
**Hand Hygiene:**  
- Before eating, preparing food, or handling any items entering your mouth.  
- After using the toilet, or after changing diapers.  
- After coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.  
- After touching frequently-touched surfaces (door handles, handrails, shopping carts) in public places. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- After caring for a sick person or handling their waste.  
- Before and after putting on or taking off a mask. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

**Mask Use:**  
- In situations where there is strong community transmission of a respiratory infection (e.g., COVID-19) and physical distancing is not always possible (e.g., crowded indoor spaces). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- When you or someone you live with is at higher risk (older age, chronic illness) and you are going into public/shared spaces.  
- In settings where local public-health guidance recommends or mandates mask usage.  
- When you are caring for a person who is ill and wearing a mask helps protect both them and you.  
- Whenever you are removing or handling a mask—be sure to clean your hands before and after. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

## How to Use Them Properly  
**Hand Hygiene Technique:**  
- Wet hands with clean running water (warm or cold), apply soap, lather all surfaces (backs, between fingers, under nails) for at least 20 seconds. Rinse and dry. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand-rub with at least 60 % alcohol. Rub until dry. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

**Mask Use Technique:**  
- Clean your hands before putting on the mask, adjust so it covers both nose, mouth and chin. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Once the mask is on, avoid touching the front of it. If you do, clean your hands.  
- Remove the mask by ear loops or ties, not the front, and immediately clean your hands. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- For reusable fabric masks: wash daily. For disposable masks: dispose safely after use. Store masks (when removed) in a clean bag or designated container. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  

## Evidence-backed Rationale  
- Hand hygiene is widely recognised as a major preventive measure against health-care associated and community-acquired infections. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- Mask use, especially combined with other measures (ventilation, distancing, hand hygiene) reduces transmission of respiratory viruses. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  

## Special Considerations  
- **Children & Schools:** Teach children how to wash hands properly, the reasons for mask-use, and supervise their correct usage.  
- **Healthcare & Care-Home Settings:** Hand hygiene and mask use are even more critical. For example, healthcare workers may clean their hands up to 100 times a shift. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Low-resource Settings / India context:** If soap and clean water are not always available, prioritise visibly dirty hands for washing, else use hand-rub. Mask availability may vary — use the best available and follow local health-authority guidance.  
- **People with Respiratory or Skin Conditions:** Masks may cause discomfort or skin irritation — ensure mask fits well, choose suitable fabric, and clean gently. Hand hygiene with frequent washing can cause dryness/irritation — use moisturiser.  
- **Incorrect Use Pitfalls:** Gloves are *not* a substitute for proper hand washing; over-reliance on masks without hand hygiene/ventilation still leaves risk. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
