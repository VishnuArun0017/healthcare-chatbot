## Overview / Definition
Tobacco use — including smoking cigarettes, cigars, or using smokeless forms like chewing tobacco — is a major cause of preventable disease, disability, and death worldwide.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco), tobacco kills over 8 million people every year, including more than 1.3 million non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke.

Quitting tobacco has immediate and long-term benefits at any age — lowering the risk of heart disease, lung disease, cancer, and improving overall health and quality of life.

## Why quitting matters
Evidence from [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/how_to_quit/index.htm) shows that stopping tobacco use:
- Reduces the risk of heart attack within one year.  
- Improves lung function and circulation within weeks.  
- Lowers cancer risk over time.  
- Enhances taste and smell, reduces cough and fatigue.  
- Improves mental health and decreases stress over the long term.  
- Protects family and friends from second-hand smoke.

## Common withdrawal symptoms
When quitting, it’s normal to experience some short-term effects as your body adjusts:
- Cravings for tobacco  
- Irritability or anxiety  
- Difficulty concentrating  
- Increased appetite or mild weight gain  
- Cough or dry mouth as the body clears toxins  

These usually peak in the first few days and get better within 2–4 weeks. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or prescribed medications can help ease symptoms. ([CDC Quit Smoking Guide](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/how_to_quit/you-can-quit-today/index.htm))

## Evidence-based ways to quit
According to the [NHS Quit Smoking](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/) and [WHO guidelines](https://www.who.int/initiatives/who-quit-tobacco):
1. **Set a quit date** — plan ahead and tell supportive friends or family.  
2. **Avoid triggers** — such as alcohol, coffee, or stress moments associated with smoking.  
3. **Use proven aids** — nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, or prescription medicines like varenicline or bupropion.  
4. **Seek behavioral support** — counseling, quit lines, or digital support apps double success rates.  
5. **Reward yourself** — track smoke-free days and milestones.  
6. **Don’t give up after slips** — most people try several times before they succeed.  

For those using smokeless tobacco, gradual reduction and replacement with healthier oral substitutes (like sugar-free gum) can assist.

## Support resources
- **In India:** National Tobacco Quitline (1800-11-2356) and mCessation program via SMS ("QUIT" to 5616115).  
- **In the UK:** [NHS Stop Smoking Services](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/) provide free local help and medications.  
- **In the US:** [1-800-QUIT-NOW](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/how_to_quit/you-can-quit-today/index.htm) offers free coaching and support.

## Lifestyle & prevention tips
- Avoid exposure to environments with smoke or tobacco use.  
- Maintain healthy diet and physical activity to manage cravings and mood.  
- Practice relaxation methods (deep breathing, meditation).  
- Focus on short-term wins — better breathing, energy, and savings.  
- Replace the habit: chew gum, drink water, or go for a quick walk when cravings hit.  
- Stay away from friends or gatherings where tobacco is used until you feel in control.

## Special considerations
- **Pregnancy:** Stopping tobacco at any point improves oxygen supply and reduces risk of miscarriage, premature birth, or low birth weight. ([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco))  
- **Adolescents:** Early prevention is key — nicotine addiction can develop within weeks.  
- **Second-hand smoke:** Avoid smoking near children, elders, or indoors — there’s no safe level of exposure.  
- **Chronic illness:** Quitting improves control of diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and COPD.
