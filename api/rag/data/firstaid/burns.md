## Overview / Definition
A **burn** is damage to the skin or deeper tissues caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation.  
A **scald** is a burn from hot liquids or steam.  

According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/burns), burns can range from mild redness to life-threatening deep tissue injury.  
Prompt first aid — especially **cooling the burn early** — can reduce pain, swelling, and the risk of infection.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
From the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/burns-and-scalds/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/first-aid/burns/index.html):
- Pain, redness, and swelling of the skin.  
- Blister formation.  
- Peeling or charred skin.  
- White, waxy, or leathery patches (deep burns).  
- Difficulty breathing after inhaling smoke or chemicals.  
- Shock symptoms — pale skin, rapid pulse, weakness.  

## Red flags & when to escalate
Seek **immediate medical attention** or call your local emergency number (108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, 911 in the US) if:
- The burn is **larger than the palm of the person’s hand**.  
- The burn is **deep**, **charred**, or **white** in appearance.  
- It affects the **face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, genitals**, or **joints**.  
- There is **difficulty breathing** or burns from **smoke or chemicals**.  
- The person is **a child, older adult, or pregnant**.  
- The burn was caused by **electricity or explosion**.  
- There are **multiple burns** or signs of **shock**.

## Evidence-backed self-care
For **minor burns and scalds**, follow these steps (from [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/burns-and-scalds/) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/burns)):
1. **Cool the burn immediately** — run cool (not cold) water over the area for at least **20 minutes**.  
   - Do **not** use ice or butter — they can worsen the injury.  
2. **Remove jewelry or tight clothing** near the burn before swelling starts.  
3. **Cover the burn** with a clean, non-stick dressing or cling film (plastic wrap).  
4. **Avoid popping blisters** — they protect against infection.  
5. **Take pain relief** (e.g., paracetamol) if needed, following package instructions.  
6. **Seek medical help** if redness spreads, blisters enlarge, or pain increases after a day.  

**Do not:**  
- Apply toothpaste, oil, butter, or traditional remedies — they trap heat and cause infection.  
- Peel off stuck clothing; cut around it instead.  

## Prevention / lifestyle
From [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/burns) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/burns-and-scalds/):
- Keep hot drinks, stoves, and irons away from children’s reach.  
- Turn pot handles inward while cooking.  
- Test bath water temperature before use.  
- Store chemicals securely and label them properly.  
- Install smoke alarms and fire extinguishers at home.  
- Wear protective gloves when handling hot objects or chemicals.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Have thinner skin and burn more easily — even a brief exposure can cause severe injury.  
- **Older adults:** Slower healing and higher infection risk — all burns should be reviewed.  
- **Pregnancy:** Smoke inhalation and infection can affect both mother and baby; always seek care.  
- **Chronic illness:** Diabetic or immune-compromised individuals need early wound review to prevent complications.
