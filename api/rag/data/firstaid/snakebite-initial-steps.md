## Overview / Definition  
A snakebite occurs when the fangs of a venomous or non‑venomous snake puncture the skin. Bites can cause local tissue damage, bleeding, allergic reactions, or systemic envenoming depending on the species.  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), prompt first aid and rapid access to medical care are crucial to reduce complications and fatalities. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
Not all snakebites inject venom (“dry bites”), but **all bites should be treated as potentially dangerous** until evaluated by a healthcare professional.

## Common symptoms / Warning signs  
From NHS and Mayo Clinic guidance:  
- Puncture wounds at the bite site, often with two distinct fang marks. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Pain, swelling, redness, or bruising around the bite. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or fainting in some cases. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Progressive swelling, blisters, or tissue damage if envenoming occurs. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Systemic signs may include difficulty breathing, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, abnormal bleeding, or paralysis. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek **urgent medical attention** or call emergency services if:  
- The snake is **venomous or unknown**. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Bite involves the **face, neck, hands, or feet**. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- There is **rapidly spreading swelling, severe pain, or bleeding**. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Symptoms of **systemic envenoming** develop: dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, blurred vision, excessive salivation, or abnormal bleeding. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- The victim is **child, elderly, pregnant, or has chronic illness**, increasing risk of severe reactions. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

## Evidence‑backed first aid steps  
While waiting for medical help:  
1. **Call emergency services immediately.** Time is critical. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
2. **Keep the person calm and still**; limit movement to slow venom spread. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
3. **Immobilize the bitten limb** with a splint if possible, keeping it at or below heart level. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
4. **Remove tight clothing, jewellery, or watches** near the bite to prevent constriction as swelling develops. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
5. **Clean the wound gently with soap and water**, but do **not** cut, suck, or apply a tourniquet. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
6. **Cover loosely with a clean, dry bandage**. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
7. **Monitor vital signs** (breathing, pulse, consciousness) and be ready for CPR if necessary.  

## Prevention / Lifestyle  
- Avoid areas with snakes, especially tall grass, piles of leaves, or rocks. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- Wear protective clothing, boots, and gloves in snake‑prone areas.  
- Educate children on snake awareness and safe behaviour outdoors.  
- Do **not attempt to capture or kill snakes**. Keep a safe distance. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- Keep homes and surroundings clean to discourage rodents and snakes.  

## Special considerations  
- **Children**: More vulnerable to venom effects due to smaller body mass; immediate care is essential. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- **Pregnant individuals**: Venom can affect both mother and fetus; urgent medical evaluation is critical.  
- **Travellers to regions with venomous snakes**: Learn local snakebite first aid protocols and antivenom availability.  
- **Non‑venomous bites**: Still require wound cleaning and monitoring for infection. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
