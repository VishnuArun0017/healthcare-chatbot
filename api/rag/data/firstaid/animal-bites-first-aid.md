## Overview / Definition  
An animal bite is any wound caused by an animal’s teeth, claws, or beak, which breaks the skin or damages tissue.  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO)-fact-sheet, animal bites can lead to serious infection or viral illnesses (including Rabies) especially if not managed promptly. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
Most domestic pet bites are minor, but bites that break the skin should **always** be treated promptly and monitored.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From NHS and Mayo Clinic guidance:  
- A puncture or tear wound from an animal bite. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Bleeding, pain, swelling, or redness at the site of the bite. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Wound contaminated by dirt, teeth fragments, or unknown animal. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- If left untreated, signs of infection may appear: increased redness, warmth, pus, spreading redness/streaks, fever. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek **urgent medical attention** or go directly to an emergency department if:  
- The wound is **large, deep**, or involves the **face, head, neck, hands or feet**. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Bleeding cannot be stopped with pressure, or bone/tissue damage is visible. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- The animal is **wild**, stray, or unknown vaccination status (especially in rabies‐endemic areas). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- There are signs of infection (fever, spreading redness, pus) or you have **immunocompromise**, diabetes, or other risk. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- You are uncertain about your tetanus immunisation status or the animal bite was in a high‐risk area. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
If the bite is minor and the bitten person is otherwise healthy:  
1. Wash hands thoroughly, then **clean the wound** with soap and running water for several minutes. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
2. Apply pressure to stop bleeding if needed; elevate limb if possible. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
3. Pat dry with a clean cloth, apply a sterile dressing/bandage. Avoid closing deep or dirty wounds without medical review. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
4. Monitor for signs of infection in the coming days (redness, swelling, warmth, pus, fever).  
5. Ensure tetanus vaccination is up to date; if animal was unknown or wild, or rabies risk exists — seek specialist advice. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Avoid close interaction with unfamiliar animals, especially stray or wild animals. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Educate children on safe behaviour around pets and animals. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- Keep pet vaccinations up to date (including rabies where relevant).  
- Use protective gear if working with animals (gloves, boots).  
- Seek medical care promptly if you animal‐bite even minor and it breaks skin.

## Special considerations  
- **Children**: More likely to get bites on face/head (lower height) and need prompt medical review. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **People with chronic illness or immunocompromise**: Higher risk for serious infection, so lower threshold for professional care.  
- **Travellers to rabies‐endemic regions or dealing with wild animals**: Immediate evaluation for rabies post-exposure protocol is needed. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- **Bites from humans**: Also require medical review due to risk of blood-borne virus transmission (Hepatitis, HIV). :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
