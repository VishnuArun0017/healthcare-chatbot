## Overview / Definition
Cuts and bleeding occur when the skin or tissue is damaged.  
Most small cuts and grazes can be safely treated at home, but **severe or persistent bleeding** can quickly become life-threatening and needs emergency help.

The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/first-aid) emphasizes early bleeding control as a crucial first aid skill to prevent shock and infection.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
From the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cuts-and-grazes/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/first-aid/bleeding/index.html):
- Visible bleeding or open wound on the skin.  
- Pain, redness, or swelling around the injury.  
- Blood soaking through dressings or dripping continuously.  
- Numbness, tingling, or loss of movement near the cut (possible nerve damage).  
- Pus, warmth, or spreading redness (infection signs).  
- Dizziness or weakness from blood loss.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your **local emergency number** (108/112 in India, 999 in UK, 911 in US) or go to the **emergency department immediately** if:
- Bleeding **does not stop after 10 minutes** of firm pressure.  
- Blood is **spurting** or pooling quickly.  
- You suspect **arterial bleeding** (bright red, pulsating).  
- The wound is **deep**, caused by **glass, metal, or bite**, or involves **bone exposure**.  
- The person becomes **pale, weak, or dizzy** (possible shock).  
- The wound is on the **face, neck, chest, abdomen, or genitals**.  
- The injured person is **on blood thinners** or has a bleeding disorder.  
- There is **severe pain**, **loss of sensation**, or **inability to move** the affected area.

## Evidence-backed self-care
For **minor cuts and grazes**, the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cuts-and-grazes/) recommends:
1. **Wash your hands** thoroughly before touching the wound.  
2. **Clean the wound gently** under running water — avoid antiseptics directly in the wound.  
3. **Stop bleeding:**  
   - Apply gentle, firm pressure with a clean cloth or sterile dressing for several minutes.  
4. **Protect the wound:**  
   - Cover with a sterile plaster or bandage.  
   - Change dressing daily or when wet.  
5. **Watch for infection:**  
   - Redness, swelling, pain, or pus → seek medical advice.  
6. **Elevate** the injured area if possible to reduce swelling and bleeding.  

Avoid blowing on or touching the wound unnecessarily, as this can introduce bacteria.

## Prevention / lifestyle
From [WHO First Aid](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/first-aid) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cuts-and-grazes/):
- Keep **first aid supplies** (sterile gauze, gloves, bandages) at home and in vehicles.  
- Use **protective gear** during sports or manual work.  
- Keep **tetanus vaccinations** up to date.  
- **Trim nails carefully** and use tools properly to avoid nicks.  
- Maintain good hygiene and avoid sharing personal sharp objects.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Small wounds heal quickly, but always check for dirt or embedded objects.  
- **Older adults:** Skin is fragile; even minor cuts can become infected.  
- **Pregnancy:** Seek help for any deep or infected wounds due to infection risk.  
- **Chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes):** Slower healing; monitor wounds closely for infection or delayed closure.
