## Overview / Definition  
Choking occurs when a foreign object blocks the airway, preventing air from reaching the lungs. In adults, common causes include food bolus, small objects, or vomitus. According to Mayo Clinic, a complete airway obstruction is life-threatening and requires immediate intervention. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From NHS & American Heart Association guidance:  
- Sudden inability to speak, cough, or breathe. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Clutching the throat, panicked expression, or bluish lips/face.  
- Weak or ineffective cough.  
- Loss of consciousness if airway remains blocked.  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Call **emergency services immediately** if:  
- Adult is unable to speak, breathe, or cough effectively.  
- Loss of consciousness occurs.  
- Object is sharp, large, or potentially toxic (batteries, chemicals).  
- Choking episode persists despite first aid attempts.  
- Pre-existing conditions (heart disease, airway issues) may complicate response.  

## Evidence-backed self-care / first aid steps  

### Conscious adult  
1. Encourage the person to **cough** forcefully if possible. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=3}  
2. If ineffective, perform the **Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts)**:  
   - Stand behind, wrap arms around the waist.  
   - Make a fist, place thumb just above navel.  
   - Grasp fist with other hand and give quick upward thrusts.  
   - Repeat until object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious.  
3. Alternate with **back blows** if necessary: 5 firm blows between shoulder blades.  
4. If the adult becomes unconscious: start CPR immediately and continue until emergency services arrive.  

### Conscious adult who is pregnant or obese  
1. Use **chest thrusts** instead of abdominal thrusts:  
   - Hands placed at the center of the chest, just above the sternum.  
   - Deliver quick inward thrusts to dislodge the object. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=3}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Chew food thoroughly, avoid talking or laughing while eating.  
- Cut food into small, manageable pieces.  
- Keep small objects and batteries away from adults with cognitive impairment.  
- Supervise alcohol intake during meals as intoxication increases choking risk.  
- Learn and refresh CPR and first aid skills regularly.  

## Special considerations  
- **Older adults**: Higher risk due to swallowing difficulties, dentures, or neurological issues.  
- **Adults with neurological or swallowing disorders**: May need tailored interventions.  
- **After choking episode**: Even if cleared, consider medical review to check for airway injury or aspiration.
