## Overview / Definition  
Choking happens when a foreign object (food, toy, coin, etc.) becomes lodged in a child’s airway and blocks breathing. The airway obstruction may be partial (child can cough) or complete (child cannot speak, cry or breathe). According to the Mayo Clinic, choking is life‑threatening and demands immediate response. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=3}  
Any sign of a child unable to swallow properly, or sudden onset of coughing, gagging or silent distress warrants swift action.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From NHS & British Red Cross guidance:  
- The child can’t speak, cry or make strong sounds; weak or no cough. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=3}  
- Clutching the throat, panicked appearance, bluish lips/face.  
- If partial obstruction: child may be able to cough forcefully—encourage them to keep coughing. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=3}  
- Sudden inability to swallow, drooling, pointing to throat.  
- If infant: may have airway blocked by milk/food, head may be leaning forward, distress. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek **emergency medical help immediately** if:  
- The child cannot breathe, cry or speak; airway completely blocked.  
- They lose consciousness or become unresponsive.  
- You are unable to clear the obstruction after first‑aid attempts.  
- The object swallowed is sharp, large, or a battery/chemical object.  
- The child is very young (infant), or has underlying medical conditions.  
- After the event: even if the child seems okay but had a choking episode, medical review is advisable (risk of airway damage or delayed complications).

## Evidence‑backed self‑care / first aid steps  
Follow age‑appropriate steps **while** waiting for emergency help or until the blockage is cleared:  

### For children (over 1 year) who are conscious and choking  
1. Encourage them to cough if they are able—this may clear the blockage naturally. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
2. If coughing does not clear it and the child is still conscious:  
   - Give up to **5 firm back blows** between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   - If still blocked: give up to **5 abdominal thrusts** (Heimlich type) — for children over 1 year. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
3. Alternate back blows and abdominal thrusts until: the object comes out, the child can cough/breathe/speak, or becomes unconscious. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
4. If the child becomes unconscious or breathing stops: start CPR immediately (if trained) and continue until help arrives. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

### For infants (under 1 year) who are conscious and choking  
1. Sit down and support the infant face‑down on your forearm/thigh, head lower than the body. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
2. Give up to **5 firm back blows** between their shoulder blades. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
3. If still choking: turn the baby face‑up (still head lower than body) and **give up to 5 chest thrusts** (2 fingers in centre of chest just below nipple line). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
4. Repeat back blows and chest thrusts until the object is expelled or infant becomes unresponsive. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
5. If infant becomes unconscious: begin infant CPR and call emergency services.  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Keep small objects, coins, buttons, batteries, balloons out of reach of young children. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Ensure children sit upright when eating; supervise mealtimes especially for toddlers. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Teach children not to run or play with food in mouth.  
- Have age‑appropriate toys and supervise infants putting things in their mouths.  
- Ensure caregivers are trained in CPR/first‑aid for children. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

## Special considerations  
- **Infants and toddlers**: Higher risk because airway is smaller and they tend to put objects in their mouth. Immediate action reduces risk of brain damage from oxygen deprivation.  
- **Children with developmental delay or swallowing disorders**: May need extra supervision during eating.  
- **Schools, daycare settings**: Staff should have training, objects small enough to swallow must be restricted, and emergency protocols in place.  
- **After choking episode**: Even if resolved, medical assessment is wise to check for residual airway injury or aspiration.
