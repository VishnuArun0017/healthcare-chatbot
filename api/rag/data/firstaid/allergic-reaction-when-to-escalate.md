## Overview / Definition  
An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts to a substance (allergen) that is usually harmless, such as foods, insect stings, medications, or environmental triggers. Severe reactions can progress to **anaphylaxis**, which is life-threatening and requires immediate medical intervention. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
Based on NHS & Mayo Clinic guidance:  
- Mild to moderate reactions: itching, hives, rash, mild swelling. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps.  
- Respiratory symptoms: sneezing, nasal congestion, mild wheezing.  
- Severe reactions / anaphylaxis: difficulty breathing, swelling of face/lips/tongue, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, loss of consciousness. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek **urgent medical attention** or call emergency services immediately if:  
- There are **signs of anaphylaxis** (trouble breathing, throat tightness, swelling of face or tongue). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Rapid progression of symptoms after allergen exposure.  
- Collapse, fainting, or low blood pressure.  
- Symptoms do not improve with initial first aid measures, such as antihistamines.  
- Known severe allergy with previous anaphylactic episodes; immediate use of epinephrine (auto-injector) is indicated.  

## Evidence-backed self-care / first aid  
1. **Mild reactions**:  
   - Remove or avoid allergen exposure.  
   - Take oral antihistamines if appropriate. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
   - Apply cool compress to reduce skin irritation.  
2. **Severe reactions / anaphylaxis**:  
   - Use epinephrine auto-injector immediately if available. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
   - Call emergency services immediately (do not wait to see if symptoms improve).  
   - Have the person lie down with legs elevated unless breathing difficulty occurs.  
   - Repeat epinephrine every 5–15 minutes if symptoms persist and another dose is available.  
   - Administer supplemental oxygen if trained and available.  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Identify and avoid known allergens. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Carry emergency medication if prescribed (e.g., epinephrine auto-injector).  
- Educate family, friends, and colleagues about the signs of severe allergic reactions.  
- Read labels carefully and ask about ingredients when eating out.  
- Wear medical alert identification if prone to severe allergies.  

## Special considerations  
- **Children**: May show atypical symptoms, such as persistent crying or lethargy.  
- **Adults with comorbidities**: Heart disease or asthma can worsen reaction severity. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Previous anaphylaxis history**: Lower threshold for urgent care and early epinephrine administration.  
- **Travelers**: Carry medications and know local emergency services access.
