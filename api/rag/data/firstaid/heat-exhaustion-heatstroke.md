## Overview / Definition  
Heat‑related illnesses occur when the body cannot properly regulate its temperature in high heat or humidity, or when excessive physical activity exceeds cooling capacity. The spectrum ranges from mild heat cramps → heat exhaustion → the life‑threatening condition known as heat stroke. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heat is now one of the leading weather‑related killers, and prompt first aid + cooling is crucial. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From NHS & Mayo Clinic guidance:  
- For **heat exhaustion**: heavy sweating, cool/clammy skin, faintness or dizziness, muscle cramps, nausea or vomiting, rapid weak pulse. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- For **heat stroke**: very high body temperature (often ≥ 40 °C/104 °F), hot/dry or heavily sweating skin, confusion or altered mental state, fainting or seizures. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek emergency care **immediately** if:  
- Someone shows signs of heat stroke: very high temperature, confusion, lack of sweating (in some cases), loss of consciousness, seizures. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Heat exhaustion symptoms do **not** improve within about 1 hour of cooling and rest. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- The person is a child, older adult, pregnant, or has underlying illness or is taking medications that make them more vulnerable to heat.  

## Evidence‑backed self‑care / first aid steps  
If someone is showing signs of heat exhaustion (and not yet heat stroke):  
1. Move them to a **cool or shaded area**, have them rest. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
2. Remove unnecessary clothing; help them cool off (fan, spray water, wet cloths on skin). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
3. Encourage drinking cool water or a rehydration‑type drink (if they’re conscious and able).  
4. Monitor: if condition worsens (confusion, high temp, vomiting), treat as heat stroke and get emergency help.  
5. For suspected heat stroke: call emergency services, cool the person aggressively (ice packs to neck/armpits/groin, cool bath if possible) while waiting. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Stay hydrated — especially in high heat/humidity or when doing physical work outdoors.  
- Avoid strenuous activity during hottest parts of day; take frequent rest/shade breaks. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Wear loose, light‑colored, breathable clothing; use shade and fans when possible.  
- Be aware of personal risk: children, elderly, those with chronic illness, or on certain medications.  

## Special considerations  
- **Children & older adults**: Less able to regulate heat, so quicker escalation to heat stroke possible.  
- **Pregnant individuals or people with chronic illness**: They may have less physiological reserve.  
- **Outdoor workers or athletes**: Acclimatization important; increase breaks and cooling when environment is hot/humid.  
- Even if someone appears fine, if they have been exposed to high heat + exertion + sweating + little fluid — treat with caution.
