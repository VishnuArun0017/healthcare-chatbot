## Overview / Definition  
A nosebleed (also called “epistaxis”) is bleeding from inside the nose, often from small blood vessels in the front part of the nasal cavity. According to the NHS, most nosebleeds are not serious and can be managed with simple first aid. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
While many are minor, it is important to know when bleeding may signal a more serious underlying problem or require urgent care.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From the NHS and Mayo Clinic guidance:  
- Bleeding from one nostril or both. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Feeling of fluid or blood trickling down the back of the throat. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- The nose may look red or there may be visible blood around the nostrils.  
- Recurring small-volume nosebleeds, or bleeding associated with nose picking, dry nasal lining, or blowing the nose hard. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

These symptoms do *not always* require emergency care, but they do need proper first aid and monitoring.

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek **urgent medical help** (call your local emergency number) or go to the hospital if any of the following apply:  
- Bleeding lasts **more than 20–30 minutes** despite first aid. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Bleeding is **heavy**, you feel very weak, dizzy or faint. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Nosebleed follows a **head injury**, **facial trauma**, or suspected broken nose. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Person is on **blood thinner medication**, has a bleeding disorder, or frequent unexplained nosebleeds. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Bleeding is from **far back inside the nose** (posterior epistaxis) or involves both nostrils heavily.  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
For a typical nosebleed in someone stable and alert, follow these steps (based on NHS and Mayo Clinic advice):  
1. Sit up straight, lean the head **slightly forward** (avoid leaning back) so blood doesn’t run down the throat. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
2. Pinch the soft part of the nose (just above the nostrils) between your thumb and forefinger and hold firmly for **10–15 minutes** without releasing. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
3. Breathe through your mouth while pinching.  
4. After bleeding stops, avoid blowing nose hard, heavy lifting, hot drinks/foods, picking the nose or bending over for at least several hours. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
5. Using a cool cloth or ice pack on the bridge of the nose may help but is optional. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

If bleeding restarts or persists, seek medical review.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
Based on guidance from children-focused sources:  
- Keep the nasal lining moist: use a humidifier or apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly inside nostrils (especially in dry climates). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Avoid picking or blowing nose forcefully, especially when dry or congested. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Trim fingernails for children to reduce injury risk inside nostrils.  
- If you have high blood pressure, bleeding disorders or are on blood thinners — follow the medical advice for managing those conditions.

## Special considerations  
- **Children**: They may struggle to follow first-aid instructions; always supervise and ensure they lean forward and pinch correctly. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Older adults**: More likely to have blood-thinner medication, fragile blood vessels, or underlying disease — lower threshold for medical review.  
- **Chronic illness / blood disorders**: Frequent nosebleeds may signal an underlying problem requiring ENT (ear-nose-throat) review or hematology input. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
