## Overview / Definition  
Dehydration happens when your body loses more fluids (and sometimes salts) than it takes in, disrupting normal functions. The World Health Organization notes that in many cases of diarrhoea or heavy fluid loss, dehydration is the key risk. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
While mild dehydration may just feel like thirst or fatigue, it can escalate — so any sign of fluid loss should be taken seriously.

## Common symptoms / warning signs  
From NHS & Mayo Clinic guidance:  
- Feeling very thirsty, dry mouth or lips. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Peeing less often than usual, or dark yellow/strong‑smelling urine. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Dizziness, light‑headed when standing up, tiredness or confusion. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- In babies/young children: sunken eyes or fontanelle (soft spot), fewer wet nappies. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- If severe: cold or blotchy skin, very little or no urine, rapid heartbeat or breathing, lethargy. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

## Red flags & when to escalate  
Seek urgent medical attention (or go to emergency) if:  
- The person is showing signs of **severe dehydration**: very little or no urine, extreme drowsiness or confusion, cold/mottled skin, rapid heartbeat. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- They cannot keep fluids down (e.g., vomiting continually) or have diarrhoea that’s causing rapid fluid loss. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- They are a **baby, young child, older adult**, pregnant person, or have chronic illness making them more vulnerable.  
- You’re not sure about the cause, or symptoms worsen despite rehydration.  

## Evidence‑backed self‑care / first aid steps  
If you suspect mild to moderate dehydration and there’s no immediate danger:  
1. Stop further fluid loss: move to a cooler place (if heat/sweating is the cause), rest.  
2. Drink fluids: water is fine; for more substantial losses consider electrolyte‑rich / oral rehydration solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
3. Sip drinks slowly but steadily, especially if nauseous. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
4. Monitor urine output, colour (should become pale), and overall symptoms (energy, dizziness).  
5. Prevent recurrence: ensure adequate fluid intake, avoid excessive sweating/uncontrolled fluid loss, manage illness causing vomiting/diarrhoea early.  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Drink fluids regularly throughout the day — don’t wait until you’re super thirsty. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Increase fluid intake when you’re ill (fever, vomiting, diarrhoea), during hot weather, or when exercising heavily. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Avoid drinks that can dehydrate you more (e.g., large amounts of alcohol). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Make sure children, older adults, and people with health conditions are monitored for signs of fluid loss more closely.  

## Special considerations  
- **Children & infants**: They can become dehydrated much faster; keep a close eye if they’re vomiting, have diarrhoea or reduced intake. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Older adults / frail individuals**: Their thirst response may be reduced; fluid loss may be more subtle but dangerous.  
- **People with chronic illness** (e.g., kidney, heart issues) or on medications like diuretics: risk is higher and you need lower threshold for seeking help. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
