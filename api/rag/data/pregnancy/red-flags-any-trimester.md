## Overview / Definition
At any point during pregnancy (first, second or third trimester), there can be **warning signs** that indicate serious risk to the mother, baby, or both.  
The :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} notes that early detection of such red-flags saves lives and reduces complications.   
The :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} and :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} provide practical checklists of symptoms that should prompt urgent review.   

## Common symptoms / warning signs
These are key symptoms often reported before a complication:  
- New or increased vaginal bleeding or passing clots.  
- Sudden or severe abdominal pain or cramping.  
- Severe headache, blurred vision, or sudden swelling of hands/face.  
- Decreased fetal movements (after week 20) or no baby movement felt.  
- Leaking fluid from the vagina (possible broken amniotic sac).  
- Shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations.  
- High fever, chills, or strong smell odor (possible infection).  
- Side pain below the ribs (possible pre-eclampsia or liver issues).  
- Sudden onset of swelling in legs/feet with headaches or proteinuria.  
- Fainting, confusion, or seizures at any stage of pregnancy.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your local emergency number (108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, or 911 in the US) **without delay** if you experience any of the above symptoms.  
Even if you’re unsure, it’s safer to get evaluated.  
According to NHS and CDC, some symptoms may indicate: ectopic pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, preterm labour, sepsis, or fetal distress.   

## Evidence-backed self-care
If no red flags are present but you’re pregnant:
1. Keep prenatal appointments and follow your provider’s guidance.  
2. Rest and hydrate well — avoid dehydration and fatigue.  
3. Monitor baby movements (after about week 20) and report changes.  
4. Eat a balanced diet, avoid harmful substances (tobacco, alcohol, drugs).  
5. Know your hospital/clinic route, emergency number, and contact your provider if any concerns arise.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Attend every scheduled antenatal visit.  
- Maintain healthy blood pressure, sugar levels, and weight.  
- Avoid high-risk behaviours; get vaccinations when advised.  
- Educate yourself on early labour signs if nearing term.  
- Ensure you know who to call and where to go in an emergency.

## Special considerations
- **Multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets):** Higher risk of complications — follow stricter monitoring.  
- **Existing medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease):** Require closer supervision.  
- **Teen pregnancy or older maternal age:** Higher risk category — don’t skip any warning symptom.  
- **Travel in pregnancy:** If you’re abroad or remote, know where your nearest emergency maternity unit is.
