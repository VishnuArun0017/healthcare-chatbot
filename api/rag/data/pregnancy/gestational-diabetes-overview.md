## Overview / Definition  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} is a condition where a woman without previously diagnosed diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy.  
It usually appears around weeks 24–28 of pregnancy and is caused by hormones from the placenta interfering with insulin. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes) fact sheet emphasises the importance of monitoring maternal and fetal health in such cases.

## Common symptoms / what to expect  
From the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/gestational-diabetes.html):
- Often there are **no noticeable symptoms** — screening is key.  
- If present: increased thirst, more frequent urination, fatigue, or blurred vision.  
- Because many symptoms overlap with “normal” pregnancy changes, routine screening is commonly used.

## Red flags & when to seek help  
If you have gestational diabetes and notice any of the following, talk to your healthcare provider sooner:
- High or rapidly rising blood sugar readings (if monitoring at home).  
- Symptoms of possible complications: frequent infections (especially urinary), sudden swelling, headaches, vision changes.  
- Reduced fetal movement (in later pregnancy).  
- You’re unable to follow your meal or glucose plan because of nausea/vomiting.  
- Any of the symptoms described under “pregnancy-red-flags-any-trimester.md” (bleeding, pain, etc) appear.

Early detection and management reduce risks to both mother and baby.

## Evidence-backed self-care  
Based on NHS & CDC guidelines:
1. **Attend your scheduled screening test**, often between weeks 24–28.  
2. **Follow your dietary plan**: balanced meals, control carbohydrate intake, regular snacks.  
3. **Monitor your blood sugar** as advised by your provider.  
4. **Stay active** — gentle to moderate exercise (walking, prenatal yoga) helps regulate blood sugar.  
5. **Avoid sugary drinks and processed carbs**; focus on whole grains, vegetables, lean protein.  
6. **Stay hydrated**, get sufficient rest, and manage stress.

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- If you’re thinking of pregnancy or in early pregnancy and have risk factors (obesity, family history of diabetes, PCOS), discuss screening earlier with your provider.  
- Maintain healthy weight and physical activity before and during pregnancy.  
- Regular antenatal check-ups ensure early detection of gestational diabetes.  
- After delivery, maintain healthy habits: gestational diabetes increases risk of type 2 diabetes later in life.

## Special considerations  
- **Multiple pregnancies** (twins/more): risk of gestational diabetes is higher — closer monitoring needed.  
- **Pre-existing conditions** (e.g., PCOS, prior gestational diabetes, obesity): may require earlier screening and stricter management.  
- **Postpartum**: Glucose levels usually return to normal but you will need follow-up testing (6–12 weeks after birth) and lifestyle support to reduce long-term risk of diabetes.
