## Overview / Definition
The postpartum period begins immediately after birth and lasts up to 6 weeks (sometimes longer). It’s a critical time for both mother and baby as the body recovers from pregnancy and childbirth, and adapts to new rhythms.  
According to the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} this phase carries potential risks if warning signs are not recognised early.   

## Common what-to-expect changes
Following a birth, many physical and emotional changes are normal:  
- Mild bleeding (lochia) lasting up to 6 weeks.  
- Uterus gradually returning to pre-pregnancy size.  
- Breasts changing with milk production.  
- Mood swings, tiredness, and new-parent stress.  
- Insufficient sleep and recovery from labour.  
However, while these are typical, certain symptoms should never be ignored.

## Warning signs & when to seek urgent help
You should contact your doctor or go to emergency services **if any** of the following occur:  
- Heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking a pad per hour for more than 2 hours) or large clots.  
- Fever ≥ 38 °C (100.4 °F) with chills or sweats.  
- Severe abdominal pain, redness, swelling of the abdomen that worsens.  
- Chest pain, difficulty breathing, fainting, or fluttering heartbeats.  
- Breast redness, heat or swelling, especially with fever (possible mastitis).  
- Persistent vomiting, unable to keep fluids down, signs of dehydration.  
- Severe headache with vision changes or swelling of face/hands (possible pre‐eclampsia).  
- Signs of infection: foul-smelling discharge, pain during urination, swelling or redness of legs (possible DVT).  
- Sudden worsening of mood, thoughts of self-harm, inability to care for baby (postpartum depression/psychosis)   

## Evidence-backed self-care
If no major warning signs are present, follow these supportive steps:  
1. Rest as much as possible and build a support network.  
2. Stay hydrated and eat nutritious meals to aid recovery.  
3. Attend all scheduled postnatal check-ups and follow your provider’s advice.  
4. Practice gentle physical activity (as advised) to improve circulation and mood.  
5. Keep track of symptoms and baby-care routines; report anything unusual promptly.  

## Prevention / lifestyle tips
- Arrange postnatal help from family or friends so you’re not over-reaching too early.  
- Recognise your body’s cues — fatigue, pain, altered mood are signals to slow down.  
- Monitor your mood and mental health — ask for help if you’re overwhelmed.  
- Keep up with infant feeding and safe sleep guidelines for baby.  
- Know your emergency contact numbers and where to go if something feels wrong.

## Special considerations
- **Women who had a C-section**: Watch for wound infection, severe pain, or heavy bleeding.  
- **Multiple births**: Higher risk of complications – extra vigilance needed.  
- **Existing health conditions** (e.g., hypertension, diabetes): Postpartum complications are more likely; follow specialist advice.  
- **Premature baby or neonatal intensive care stay**: Both mother and baby may need extra monitoring and support.
