## Overview / Definition  
“Morning sickness” is the term commonly used for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. It can begin as early as around week 6 and often improves by week 12-14. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
Despite the name, it can happen at any time of day and varies in severity. Most cases are self-limiting and manageable with lifestyle measures.

## Common symptoms / things to expect  
Based on the NHS guidance: :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Feeling nauseous, queasy, or even slightly sick when you least expect it.  
- Vomiting or dry retching (not always every day).  
- Loss of appetite, aversion to certain smells or foods.  
- Tiredness, light-headedness (often worsened by dehydration or skipping meals).  
- Symptoms often peak around week 9 and improve thereafter. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## Evidence-backed self-care  
If there are no worrying features, you can try these supportive steps:  
1. Eat **small, frequent meals** — plain, high-carb, low-fat foods (e.g., toast, crackers, rice). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
2. Keep **fluids up** — sip water, ginger tea or plain fluids regularly throughout the day. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
3. Avoid foods, smells or environments that trigger nausea (hot meals, strong odours, spicy/fatty foods). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
4. Rest when you can — tiredness can make nausea worse. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
5. Try home remedies that are generally low-risk: e.g., dry toast before getting up, ginger-infused snacks/drinks. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

## Red flags & when to seek medical help  
You should contact your doctor, midwife, or go to urgent care **if**, for example:  
- You cannot keep any fluids or food down for **24 hours**.  
- You’ve lost more than **5% of pre-pregnancy weight**, or show signs of dehydration (dark urine, dizziness). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- You have **persistent vomiting**, fever, abdominal pain, or other concerning symptoms (these may signal a more serious issue such as Hyperemesis of Pregnancy) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Keep a light snack on your bedside (so you can eat something before standing).  
- Avoid long gaps without food — even a small snack helps.  
- Quit or avoid smoking and alcohol (non-negotiable in pregnancy).  
- Let your maternity provider know if symptoms escalate — early intervention helps.  

## Special considerations  
- **Multiple pregnancies (twins or more):** may increase severity of nausea, so closer monitoring is needed.  
- **Existing health conditions (e.g., thyroid issues, diabetes):** may complicate nausea and vomiting — discuss with your provider.  
- **Emotional support:** Don’t underestimate the mental toll of persistent nausea — ask for help if you feel down or hopeless.
