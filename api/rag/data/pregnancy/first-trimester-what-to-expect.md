## Overview / Definition
The **first trimester** of pregnancy spans from **week 1 to week 12**, when your baby’s major organs and body systems begin to form.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550215) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-pregnancy-and-baby-guide/), this stage is critical for both maternal and fetal health — and early prenatal care helps detect and prevent complications.

## Common symptoms / what to expect
The [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-pregnancy-and-baby-guide/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/) describe these as **typical first-trimester experiences**:
- **Missed period** (often the first sign).  
- **Morning sickness** — nausea or vomiting, especially early in the day.  
- **Breast tenderness and swelling.**  
- **Tiredness or fatigue.**  
- **Frequent urination.**  
- **Mood changes** due to hormonal shifts.  
- **Mild cramping or light spotting** (can occur when the embryo implants).  
- **Food cravings or aversions.**

Most of these are normal and temporary as your body adjusts to pregnancy hormones.

## Red flags & when to seek urgent care
Call your doctor, midwife, or emergency number **immediately** if you experience:
- Heavy vaginal bleeding or passing clots.  
- Severe abdominal pain or cramping.  
- Persistent vomiting unable to keep fluids down (possible dehydration).  
- Dizziness, fainting, or signs of weakness.  
- High fever, chills, or burning while urinating.  
- Sudden swelling of face, hands, or feet (may indicate high blood pressure).  
- Any trauma, fall, or accident affecting the abdomen.  

These may be signs of **miscarriage**, **ectopic pregnancy**, or **severe infection**, all requiring urgent evaluation.

## Evidence-backed self-care
Guided by [WHO Antenatal Care Recommendations](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550215) and [CDC Pregnancy Health Tips](https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/):
1. **Book your first antenatal appointment** early (ideally by week 8–10).  
2. **Take prenatal vitamins** — especially folic acid (400 mcg daily) to prevent birth defects.  
3. **Eat balanced meals** with fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.  
4. **Avoid alcohol, smoking, and unprescribed drugs.**  
5. **Rest adequately** and manage stress gently.  
6. **Stay hydrated** and eat smaller, frequent meals to reduce nausea.  
7. **Avoid raw or undercooked meat and unpasteurized dairy** to prevent infection.  

## Prevention / lifestyle
Based on [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/):
- Attend all **antenatal checkups** for early detection of complications.  
- Maintain good **oral hygiene** to prevent gum infections.  
- Stay physically active with gentle exercise (like walking or prenatal yoga).  
- Get vaccinated as recommended by your provider (e.g., flu, tetanus).  
- Keep a record of medications and supplements taken.

## Special considerations
- **Teen pregnancies:** Need extra support and nutritional care.  
- **Multiple pregnancies (twins/triplets):** May cause stronger symptoms; closer medical monitoring is essential.  
- **Existing health conditions:** Conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid issues should be managed by a specialist.  
- **Emotional health:** Mood swings are common, but ongoing sadness or anxiety may require professional mental health support.
