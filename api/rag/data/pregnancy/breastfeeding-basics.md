## Overview / Definition  
Breastfeeding is the process of feeding an infant directly from the mother’s breast, or providing breastmilk.  
The :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} recommends initiation within one hour of birth, exclusive breastfeeding for six months, and continued breastfeeding with complementary foods up to two years or beyond.   
Breastmilk provides optimal nutrition, immune support, and bonding opportunities for mother and baby.

## Common benefits & what to expect  
From the :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} and :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:  
- Supplies all the nutrients an infant needs for the first six months.   
- Supports the baby’s immune system and reduces risk of infections.  
- Promotes maternal health: lowers risk of postpartum bleeding, supports weight loss, and may reduce future breast/ovarian cancer risk.  
- Facilitates skin-to-skin contact and aids emotional bonding.

## Self-care / What mothers can do  
1. **Find a comfortable position** with support for your back, arms, and baby.  
2. **Start feeding early** – offer the breast when your baby shows feeding cues (rooting, bringing hand to mouth).  
3. **Feed on demand** – newborns may feed 8–12 times per 24 hours.  
4. **Ensure good latch** – baby’s mouth wide, lips flanged, chin touching breast; no ongoing pain for the mother.  
5. **Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet**, including plenty of fluids and nutrient-rich foods.  
6. **Rest when you can** – fatigue can impact let-down and milk supply.  
7. **Seek support early** — lactation consultant, midwife or breastfeeding group if you have concerns.  
8. **Avoid smoking, limit alcohol, and avoid certain medications** while breastfeeding (check with your provider).

## Red flags & when to seek help  
Contact your healthcare or lactation professional if you experience:  
- Severe breast pain, cracked or bleeding nipples.  
- Baby not gaining weight or not producing enough wet/dirty nappies.  
- Breast engorgement not improving, or signs of infection (red, hot breast, fever).  
- Jaundice in baby worsening, or baby appears sleepy/unresponsive.  
- You suspect you’re having very low milk supply and your baby seems unsatisfied.  

## Prevention / lifestyle  
- Stay close to your baby and breastfeed frequently in the early weeks.  
- Avoid worrying about exact timing — frequent feeding is normal.  
- Switch breastfeeding positions while your body heals post-birth.  
- Maintain social support (partner, family, friends) and attend mother-baby groups if available.  
- Keep up with regular maternal checkups and baby’s growth monitoring.

## Special considerations  
- **Premature or low-birth-weight infants:** May need extra help with latching or pumped milk; early specialist support is key.  
- **Multiple births (twins, triplets):** Feeding schedules may differ; talk to lactation specialists.  
- **Maternal health issues:** Conditions like diabetes, thyroid disease, or surgery may affect supply — coordinate with your provider.  
- **Return to work or study:** Plan for expressing/pumping, safe storage of milk, and feeding routines; discuss conditions at your workplace if needed.
