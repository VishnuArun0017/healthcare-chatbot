## Overview / Definition

**Hypertension**, also called **high blood pressure**, occurs when the force of blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high.  
It is a major cause of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and premature death worldwide.  
Blood pressure is measured using two numbers:  
- **Systolic pressure (top number):** pressure during heartbeats  
- **Diastolic pressure (bottom number):** pressure between beats  

A reading of **140/90 mmHg or higher** (or **130/80 mmHg** for people with diabetes or kidney disease) is considered high.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

Most people with hypertension **do not have symptoms** — that’s why it’s called the **“silent killer.”**  
However, very high blood pressure may cause:

- Severe headache  
- Blurred vision or dizziness  
- Nosebleeds  
- Shortness of breath  
- Chest pain  
- Fatigue or confusion  

Regular blood pressure checks are the only way to detect hypertension early.

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek immediate medical help if:

- Blood pressure reading is **≥180/120 mmHg** (hypertensive crisis)  
- You experience chest pain, breathlessness, severe headache, or vision changes  
- You have weakness or numbness on one side of the body (possible stroke)  
- You have swelling in legs, confusion, or sudden fainting  

Go to the nearest hospital or call emergency services immediately.

## Evidence-backed self-care

You can help manage or prevent hypertension by following these steps:

1. **Monitor your blood pressure regularly.** Use a validated home device if possible.  
2. **Eat a balanced diet** — focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and less salt.  
3. **Reduce sodium intake** — aim for less than 5g of salt per day (1 teaspoon).  
4. **Stay physically active** — at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days.  
5. **Maintain a healthy weight.**  
6. **Avoid smoking and alcohol** or keep them minimal.  
7. **Manage stress** through deep breathing, relaxation, or hobbies.  
8. **Take prescribed medicines** exactly as directed — never skip doses.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- **Healthy diet:** Follow a low-salt, low-fat, high-fiber diet rich in fruits and vegetables.  
- **Stay active:** Regular walking, cycling, or swimming helps lower pressure naturally.  
- **Limit caffeine, alcohol, and processed foods.**  
- **Quit smoking:** It damages blood vessels and raises heart disease risk.  
- **Regular check-ups:** Adults over 30 should check BP at least once a year.  
- **Manage chronic diseases:** Diabetes, obesity, and cholesterol increase hypertension risk.  
- **Sleep well:** Aim for 7–8 hours of good sleep daily.

## Special considerations

- **Children and teens:** Hypertension can occur due to obesity or kidney problems; regular screening is important.  
- **Pregnancy:** High blood pressure can lead to complications like preeclampsia; medical supervision is essential.  
- **Older adults:** BP control helps reduce risk of heart attack and stroke.  
- **Voice-first / multilingual usage:** Use short, clear prompts like “Check blood pressure,” “Eat less salt,” “Call doctor if dizzy.”  
  Avoid abbreviations and ensure phrases are easily translatable.
