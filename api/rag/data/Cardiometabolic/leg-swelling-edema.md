## Overview / Definition

**Edema** (also called **swelling**) occurs when excess fluid builds up in the body’s tissues.  
When it affects the lower legs, ankles, or feet, it is often due to poor circulation, heart disease, kidney problems, or prolonged sitting or standing.  
Mild edema is common and may resolve on its own, but persistent or painful swelling can signal an underlying condition.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

Typical features of leg edema include:

- Swelling or puffiness of the ankles, feet, or legs  
- Skin that looks stretched, shiny, or feels tight  
- Indentation after pressing the swollen area (pitting)  
- Heaviness, stiffness, or discomfort in the legs  
- Shoes or clothes feeling tighter than usual  
- In severe cases, redness, warmth, or pain  

Edema can be temporary or ongoing depending on the cause.

## Red flags & when to escalate

🚨 Seek immediate medical care if:

- Swelling appears **suddenly** or **only in one leg** (possible blood clot)  
- The area is **red, hot, or painful** to touch  
- You have **shortness of breath** or **chest pain** (possible heart or lung issue)  
- There is **rapid weight gain** over a few days (possible fluid retention from heart failure)  
- You notice **skin sores or ulcers** that don’t heal  
- You have **kidney or liver disease** and swelling is worsening  

Do not ignore sudden or severe swelling, especially with other heart or breathing symptoms.

## Evidence-backed self-care

If your doctor confirms mild or non-serious edema, you can:

1. **Elevate your legs** above heart level for 30 minutes, a few times daily.  
2. **Move often** — avoid sitting or standing still for long periods.  
3. **Wear compression stockings** if recommended.  
4. **Limit salt intake** — excess salt causes fluid retention.  
5. **Stay hydrated** — proper hydration helps balance body fluids.  
6. **Maintain a healthy weight** and stay physically active.  
7. **Avoid tight clothing** that restricts blood flow.  

If swelling does not improve or worsens, see your healthcare provider again.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Maintain **regular physical activity** such as walking or gentle leg exercises.  
- Eat a **low-salt, balanced diet** rich in fruits and vegetables.  
- Avoid prolonged sitting, especially during travel — stretch or move every 30–60 minutes.  
- Manage chronic diseases like **hypertension, diabetes, or heart failure** carefully.  
- Avoid smoking and reduce alcohol intake.  
- Sleep with your legs slightly elevated to improve circulation.  
- Regularly monitor for changes in swelling or skin color.

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy:** Mild leg swelling is common but should be evaluated if sudden or severe (possible preeclampsia).  
- **Elderly adults:** Swelling can result from heart, kidney, or medication effects — regular check-ups are essential.  
- **People with heart or kidney disease:** Follow doctor’s advice on salt, fluids, and weight monitoring.  
- **After surgery or travel:** Gentle leg movements and hydration reduce clot and swelling risk.  
- **Voice-first / multilingual systems:** Use short prompts like “Leg swelling,” “Raise legs,” “Call doctor if sudden.” Avoid medical jargon for clarity.
