## Overview / Definition

**Cholesterol** is a fatty substance (lipid) found in your blood.  
Your body needs some cholesterol to build cells and make hormones.  
However, when cholesterol levels become too high — especially **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)** or “bad” cholesterol — it can build up in the arteries, forming plaques.  
This can narrow blood vessels, increase blood pressure, and raise the risk of **heart attack or stroke**.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

High cholesterol usually has **no visible symptoms**, which is why regular testing is essential.  
However, long-term uncontrolled cholesterol may lead to:

- Chest pain (angina) due to blocked heart arteries  
- Shortness of breath or fatigue with exertion  
- Yellowish patches (xanthomas) around eyelids or joints in rare cases  
- Sudden weakness or paralysis (stroke warning)  

Because it’s silent, cholesterol can cause serious heart problems before any signs appear.

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek prompt medical evaluation if:

- You have a **family history** of heart disease or high cholesterol  
- You experience **chest pain, dizziness, or breathlessness**  
- You are diagnosed with **diabetes, obesity, or hypertension**  
- You had a **heart attack or stroke** previously  
- Your **LDL or total cholesterol** levels are consistently high despite diet changes  

Regular blood testing (lipid profile) is key for early detection.

## Evidence-backed self-care

Here’s how to lower or manage cholesterol safely:

1. **Eat heart-healthy foods**  
   - Choose foods rich in fiber (oats, lentils, fruits, vegetables).  
   - Reduce trans fats and saturated fats (found in fried and processed foods).  
   - Include healthy fats like nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fish.  

2. **Be physically active**  
   - Aim for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling most days.  

3. **Maintain a healthy weight**  
   - Losing even 5–10% of body weight can improve cholesterol levels.  

4. **Avoid smoking and alcohol**  
   - Smoking lowers good cholesterol (HDL) and damages arteries.  

5. **Take medicines only as prescribed**  
   - If your doctor prescribes statins or lipid-lowering drugs, take them regularly.  

6. **Get regular check-ups**  
   - Adults over 30 should check cholesterol at least once every 3 years.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- **Balanced diet:** Reduce oily, salty, and sugary foods. Increase fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  
- **Regular exercise:** Keep your heart and blood vessels healthy.  
- **Control other conditions:** Manage blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.  
- **Avoid tobacco and alcohol misuse.**  
- **Stress management:** Practice relaxation, deep breathing, or yoga.  
- **Know your numbers:** Maintain LDL below 100 mg/dL and HDL above 40 mg/dL (men) / 50 mg/dL (women).

## Special considerations

- **Children:** May have inherited high cholesterol (familial hypercholesterolemia). Early screening is important if family history exists.  
- **Older adults:** Cholesterol naturally increases with age — regular monitoring helps prevent heart disease.  
- **Women:** Levels may rise after menopause; lifestyle care and regular testing are vital.  
- **People with diabetes or obesity:** Need stricter diet and medication adherence.  
- **Voice-first / multilingual systems:** Use simple phrases like “Eat less oily food,” “Check cholesterol,” “Walk daily.” Avoid abbreviations for clarity.
