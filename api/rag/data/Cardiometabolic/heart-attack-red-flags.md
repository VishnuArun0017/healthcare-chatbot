## Overview / Definition

A **heart attack** (also called **myocardial infarction**) happens when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot.  
Without quick treatment, heart muscle begins to die — making early recognition and emergency action lifesaving.  
Heart attacks are a leading cause of death globally but are often preventable through awareness and prompt care.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

Typical heart attack symptoms include:

- Chest pain or discomfort — pressure, squeezing, or heaviness in the center or left side of the chest  
- Pain that spreads to the **arm, neck, jaw, back, or stomach**  
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing  
- Cold sweat, nausea, or vomiting  
- Feeling light-headed, dizzy, or faint  
- Sudden fatigue, anxiety, or a sense of impending doom  

Symptoms may develop suddenly or gradually, lasting more than a few minutes, or coming and going.

## Red flags & when to escalate

🚨 **Call emergency services immediately (e.g., 108 in India, 999 in UK, 911 in US)** if you or someone nearby has:

- Persistent or severe chest pain or discomfort  
- Pain spreading to arm, jaw, back, or stomach  
- Difficulty breathing, sweating, or nausea  
- Collapse, unconsciousness, or unresponsiveness  
- Pain not relieved within 5 minutes of rest  

**Do not drive yourself to the hospital.** Wait for medical help or call an ambulance.

## Evidence-backed self-care (Emergency Response Steps)

If you suspect a heart attack:

1. **Call emergency medical services immediately.**  
2. **Stay calm and seated upright.** Loosen tight clothing.  
3. **If prescribed, chew one adult aspirin (if not allergic and advised by doctor).**  
4. **Keep airway clear** — if the person becomes unconscious, start CPR if trained.  
5. **Monitor breathing and pulse** until help arrives.  
6. **Do not eat, drink, or take unprescribed medicine.**  

Early medical care greatly increases survival and reduces heart damage.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- **Healthy diet:** Eat less salt, sugar, and saturated fat; include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  
- **Stay active:** At least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days.  
- **Quit smoking:** Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease.  
- **Limit alcohol and stress.**  
- **Maintain healthy weight and blood pressure.**  
- **Manage chronic diseases:** Control diabetes, cholesterol, and hypertension with regular check-ups.  
- **Regular heart screening:** Especially after age 40 or with family history of heart disease.

## Special considerations

- **Women:** May experience less typical symptoms like shortness of breath, nausea, back or jaw pain rather than chest pain.  
- **Elderly adults:** Symptoms can be subtle — weakness, confusion, or fainting may occur instead of pain.  
- **People with diabetes:** Often have “silent” heart attacks with minimal pain.  
- **Pregnancy:** Sudden chest discomfort or breathlessness needs urgent evaluation.  
- **Voice-first / multilingual systems:** Use clear short alerts like “Chest pain,” “Call ambulance,” or “Pain spreading to arm.” Avoid abbreviations or slang.
