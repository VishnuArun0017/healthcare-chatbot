## Overview / Definition

**Heart palpitations** are sensations of the heart beating too fast, too hard, skipping beats, or fluttering.  
They can be felt in the chest, throat, or neck.  
Most are harmless and caused by anxiety, caffeine, dehydration, or exercise.  
However, sometimes palpitations indicate a serious heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia).

## Common symptoms / warning signs

You may notice:

- Fluttering or pounding heartbeat  
- Feeling your heart “skip” or beat irregularly  
- Fast heartbeat (racing pulse)  
- Awareness of heartbeat when lying down or resting  
- Dizziness, weakness, or a feeling of anxiety  

Palpitations may occur occasionally or frequently, lasting seconds to minutes.

## Red flags & when to escalate

🚨 **Seek urgent medical attention** if palpitations occur with:

- Chest pain or pressure  
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing  
- Dizziness, fainting, or loss of consciousness  
- Very fast heartbeat lasting more than a few minutes  
- Irregular heartbeat that doesn’t return to normal  
- Palpitations triggered by known heart disease, thyroid problems, or medications  

Call emergency services immediately (108 in India, 999 in UK, 911 in US) if you have chest pain or collapse.

## Evidence-backed self-care

For occasional mild palpitations:

1. **Stay calm and sit or lie down** — anxiety can make palpitations worse.  
2. **Take slow, deep breaths** to relax your body.  
3. **Avoid stimulants** like caffeine, nicotine, and energy drinks.  
4. **Stay hydrated** and eat regular meals.  
5. **Limit alcohol** and manage stress with relaxation techniques.  
6. **Track episodes** — note when and what you were doing when they occur.  
7. **Get regular check-ups** to monitor heart health, especially if you have hypertension or diabetes.  

If palpitations are frequent, new, or worsening, consult a healthcare provider.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- **Avoid triggers** such as caffeine, smoking, or stress.  
- **Exercise regularly** but consult your doctor before starting new workouts.  
- **Maintain healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.**  
- **Sleep 7–8 hours nightly** — poor sleep can worsen heart rhythm problems.  
- **Eat heart-healthy foods** (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low salt).  
- **Manage anxiety or stress** using relaxation, meditation, or breathing exercises.  
- **Regular ECG screening** if you have family history of arrhythmia or heart disease.

## Special considerations

- **Children and teenagers:** Palpitations are often benign but may need evaluation if frequent or associated with fainting.  
- **Pregnancy:** Mild palpitations are common but must be reviewed if persistent or causing dizziness.  
- **Elderly adults:** Palpitations could signal arrhythmia or heart failure — early detection is vital.  
- **People with thyroid or heart conditions:** Require regular monitoring and medication review.  
- **Voice-first / multilingual chatbot use:** Use clear, short alerts like “Heartbeat fast,” “Call doctor,” “Feeling dizzy — rest.” Avoid medical abbreviations for safety.
