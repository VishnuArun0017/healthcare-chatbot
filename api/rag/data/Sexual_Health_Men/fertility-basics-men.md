## Overview / Definition

**Male fertility** depends on healthy sperm count, motility (movement), and function.  
**Infertility** is defined as the inability to conceive after **12 months of regular unprotected sex**.

## Common causes / contributing factors

- **Low sperm count** or poor sperm quality  
- **Hormonal imbalance** (testosterone or pituitary issues)  
- **Varicocele** (enlarged veins in the scrotum)  
- **Infections** affecting the reproductive tract  
- **Lifestyle factors:** smoking, alcohol, obesity, or stress  

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek medical advice if:
- Trying to conceive for **over a year** without success  
- Past testicular injury, infection, or surgery  
- Sexual or erection difficulties  
- Swelling, pain, or lump in testicles  

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Maintain a **balanced diet** with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains  
- **Exercise regularly** but avoid overtraining  
- **Limit alcohol**, avoid smoking and drug use  
- Avoid heat exposure (hot tubs, laptops on lap)  
- Manage stress and get adequate sleep  

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Keep a healthy **BMI** and stay physically active  
- Wear loose-fitting underwear for optimal temperature  
- Get treatment early for urinary or reproductive infections  
- Avoid anabolic steroids and testosterone supplements unless prescribed  

## Special considerations

- Both partners should be evaluated — fertility is a **shared concern**.  
- Many men with low sperm counts can still conceive with medical help (for example, assisted reproduction).
