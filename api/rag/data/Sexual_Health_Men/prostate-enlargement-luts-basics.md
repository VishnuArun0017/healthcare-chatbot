## Overview / Definition

**Prostate enlargement** (benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH) is a **non-cancerous growth** of the prostate gland that can affect urine flow.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Difficulty starting or weak urine stream  
- Feeling of incomplete emptying  
- Frequent urination, especially at night  
- Urgency or dribbling  

## Red flags & when to escalate

- Blood in urine or pain when passing urine  
- Inability to urinate (retention)  
- Sudden severe pain in lower abdomen  

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Limit evening fluids and caffeine  
- Double voiding (try urinating again after a short wait)  
- Stay active and manage weight  

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Avoid alcohol excess  
- Regular check-ups for prostate health  

## Special considerations

- Symptoms do not mean cancer, but testing helps rule it out.
