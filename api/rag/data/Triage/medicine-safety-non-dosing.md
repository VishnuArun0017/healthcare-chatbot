## Overview / Definition
Medication safety means using medicines in the **right way, at the right time, and for the right reason**.  
According to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-09-2022-world-patient-safety-day-2022--medication-safety), thousands of people are harmed each year by avoidable errors such as taking the wrong drug, wrong dose, or combining medicines unsafely.

This assistant focuses on **general education** — not specific prescriptions or dosage instructions — to help you stay informed while ensuring safety.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
Unsafe medicine use can cause:
- Unexpected drowsiness, dizziness, or confusion.  
- Nausea, vomiting, or stomach upset after taking a medicine.  
- Skin rash, swelling, or itching (possible allergy).  
- Unusual bleeding, yellowing of eyes, or dark urine.  
- Rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, or chest discomfort.  

If you experience any of these, **stop the medicine and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately**, as advised by the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/using-medicines-safely/).

## Red flags & when to escalate
Seek urgent medical help if:
- You took **too much medicine** (accidental or intentional overdose).  
- A child has swallowed a medicine not meant for them.  
- You develop **trouble breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or severe rash** (allergic reaction).  
- You mixed medicines with **alcohol** or **other drugs** and feel unwell.  
- You are **pregnant or breastfeeding** and unsure if a medicine is safe.  
- You experience severe confusion, fainting, or loss of consciousness.  

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/medicationsafety/basics.html) emphasizes that overdoses and drug interactions are among the most common emergency causes in medication-related harm.

## Evidence-backed self-care
Follow these universal safety steps from WHO and NHS:
1. **Read the label carefully** — check the medicine name, expiry date, and storage instructions.  
2. **Use medicines only as prescribed** for you; never share with others.  
3. **Keep a medicine list** — note drug names, times, and purposes to avoid confusion.  
4. **Ask your pharmacist or doctor** before combining new medicines, supplements, or herbal products.  
5. **Store medicines properly:** away from sunlight, moisture, and out of children’s reach.  
6. **Dispose of expired medicines safely** at local pharmacies or waste collection programs.  

> 💡 *This assistant will never give dosing instructions.*  
> Dosing depends on your **age, weight, medical history, and other medicines** — only a professional can determine the right amount safely.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Build a habit of **checking expiry dates** once a month.  
- **Avoid self-medicating** based on online or social media advice.  
- Use **pill organizers or reminders** to prevent missed or double doses.  
- **Avoid alcohol** when taking sedatives, antibiotics, or painkillers unless your doctor confirms it is safe.  
- **Ask before taking herbal or traditional remedies** — they can interact with prescribed medicines.  
- Participate in WHO’s *“Know. Check. Ask.”* campaign to become an active partner in medication safety.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Use only medicines specifically made for children; keep dosing devices labeled.  
- **Pregnancy:** Always confirm medicine safety with your obstetrician or pharmacist.  
- **Older adults:** Review medicine lists regularly; avoid duplication of similar drugs.  
- **Chronic illness:** Never stop medicines suddenly without consulting your doctor.  
- **Multiple prescriptions:** Maintain an updated medication chart to show every healthcare provider you meet.
