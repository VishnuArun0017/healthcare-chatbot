## Overview / Definition
Being able to describe your symptoms clearly helps doctors and digital health assistants give better, safer guidance.  
According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-ccs-communication-guide-primary-care) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/gps/how-to-describe-your-symptoms-to-a-doctor/), a clear description saves time, prevents misunderstanding, and ensures that important warning signs are not missed.

Your goal is to help healthcare professionals understand **what you feel, where, when, and how it changes.**

## Common symptoms / warning signs
Common ways people express symptoms include:
- **Pain:** describe the *location*, *type* (sharp, dull, throbbing, burning), and *intensity* on a scale of 1–10.  
- **Duration:** when the symptom started and whether it’s *constant* or *comes and goes*.  
- **Pattern:** does it worsen at a particular time (e.g., after meals, at night, with activity)?  
- **Triggers:** what makes it better or worse — rest, movement, food, stress, weather?  
- **Associated changes:** fever, fatigue, rash, nausea, or changes in appetite, sleep, or mood.  
- **Effect on daily life:** is it stopping you from eating, sleeping, working, or speaking?  

The [CDC’s visit preparation checklist](https://www.cdc.gov/family/checkup/questions.html) suggests keeping a simple note of these points before you talk to a doctor or chatbot.

## Red flags & when to escalate
You should always **speak directly to a doctor or emergency service** rather than describing symptoms through a chatbot if:
- The symptom started **suddenly and severely** (like chest pain or shortness of breath).  
- You have **loss of consciousness, confusion, or bleeding**.  
- Pain intensity is **8 or higher** and not improving.  
- You feel your condition is **rapidly worsening**.  
- There are **mental health crises**, such as thoughts of self-harm.  

These are urgent signs outlined by [WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-ccs-communication-guide-primary-care) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/gps/how-to-describe-your-symptoms-to-a-doctor/).

## Evidence-backed self-care
From WHO and NHS communication guidance:
1. **Be specific:** say “a sharp pain under my left ribs” instead of “pain in my side.”  
2. **Use comparisons:** for example, “it feels like pressure or tightness” helps doctors visualize.  
3. **Include time and triggers:** note when symptoms start, how long they last, and what changes them.  
4. **Mention associated feelings:** dizziness, fatigue, nausea, or anxiety help form a clearer picture.  
5. **Bring records if possible:** blood pressure, temperature, glucose logs, or medications you take.  
6. **Keep a symptom diary:** note the date, time, and severity each day — even simple notes on your phone help.

If you are talking to this bot, provide one symptom at a time. This helps it retrieve the right guidance and red-flag checks.

## Prevention / lifestyle
Good communication is part of preventive care. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-ccs-communication-guide-primary-care) recommends:
- **Know your normal baseline:** what your usual energy, appetite, and mood feel like.  
- **Don’t ignore mild symptoms** that persist for weeks; early reporting helps early diagnosis.  
- **Prepare notes** before appointments or chatbot sessions — key facts, questions, and medications.  
- **Be honest and open:** even sensitive details help health professionals guide you safely.  

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Describe what you observe — eating, crying, sleep, play, or bathroom changes.  
- **Pregnancy:** Mention any new pain, swelling, or bleeding clearly with timing.  
- **Older adults:** Describe new confusion, weakness, or changes in memory.  
- **Mental health:** Explain emotional symptoms like sadness, fear, or irritability along with physical signs.  
- **Language barriers:** Use simple words, or this chatbot’s multilingual mode, to ensure clarity.
