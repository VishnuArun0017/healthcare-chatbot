## Overview / Definition
Emergency care means rapid medical help when someone’s life, limb, or long-term health could be in danger if treatment is delayed.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/emergency-care), emergencies can include sudden illnesses, injuries, or worsening chronic conditions that need immediate action to prevent death or disability.

If you ever feel that something is *seriously wrong* with yourself or another person, treat it as urgent. Getting help early is always safer than waiting.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
The [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care-services/when-to-go-to-ae/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/first-aid/) highlight several symptoms that should prompt *urgent medical assessment*:
- Sudden or severe pain anywhere in the body.  
- High fever not improving with rest and fluids.  
- Repeated vomiting or diarrhea causing dehydration or weakness.  
- Sudden confusion, fainting, or unusual drowsiness.  
- Rapidly spreading rash, especially with fever.  
- Persistent shortness of breath or wheezing.  
- Chest pain or tightness lasting longer than a few minutes.  
- Severe headache, vision problems, or trouble speaking.  
- Heavy bleeding or open wounds that do not stop with pressure.  
- Severe abdominal pain or swelling.

These do not always mean an emergency, but they *do* need urgent medical review.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your local emergency number (for example, 108 or 112 in India, 999 in the UK, or 911 in the US) **immediately** if you notice any of the following:

From [NHS “When to go to A&E”](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care-services/when-to-go-to-ae/) and [CDC First Aid](https://www.cdc.gov/first-aid/):
- Trouble breathing, choking, or blue lips or face.  
- Chest pain, pressure, or heaviness that does not go away.  
- Sudden weakness, drooping on one side, or slurred speech (possible stroke).  
- Severe allergic reaction with swelling of face or throat, or difficulty breathing.  
- Major trauma or bleeding that won’t stop.  
- Seizure lasting more than five minutes or repeated seizures.  
- Sudden loss of consciousness or collapse.  
- Severe burns, electric shock, or suspected poisoning.  
- Heavy bleeding during pregnancy or after childbirth.  
- Any situation where a person’s breathing, pulse, or awareness is uncertain.

## Evidence-backed self-care
If you are unsure whether it is an emergency, follow these steps (based on [WHO first aid recommendations](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/first-aid)):
1. **Call for advice or emergency help** — local hotlines (108/112 in India) can guide you.  
2. **Stay calm and ensure safety** — remove hazards (electricity, fire, traffic).  
3. **Avoid driving yourself** if you feel unwell or dizzy; ask for help or an ambulance.  
4. **Keep first aid supplies** at home: clean dressings, antiseptic, oral rehydration salts, thermometer.  
5. **Write down what happened** and note when symptoms began to help professionals when they arrive.

Never delay care for severe or worsening symptoms.

## Prevention / lifestyle
Based on WHO and NHS public guidance:
- Learn basic [first aid skills](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/first-aid).  
- Keep emergency phone numbers visible at home and saved on mobile.  
- Manage chronic conditions properly to prevent sudden crises.  
- Store medicines safely and check expiry dates regularly.  
- Encourage family members to know how to respond in emergencies.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** High fever, breathing trouble, or refusal to drink fluids always need quick review.  
- **Pregnancy:** Any vaginal bleeding, severe pain, or swelling of face/hands should be treated as urgent.  
- **Older adults:** Even mild confusion or weakness can signal serious illness.  
- **Chronic illness:** Worsening breathlessness, chest discomfort, or sudden swelling should prompt immediate care.
