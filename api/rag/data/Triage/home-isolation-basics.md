## Overview / Definition
Home isolation means staying at home and minimizing contact with others while recovering from a **mild illness** that could spread — such as a cold, flu, or mild respiratory infection.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-HomeCare-2024.1) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/guidance/faqs.html), this approach helps prevent transmission and supports safe recovery without hospital care.

Home isolation is suitable only when symptoms are mild, the person can care for themselves, and there are no major risk factors like severe chronic disease or pregnancy complications.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
You can usually stay home if you have mild symptoms such as:
- Low-grade fever.  
- Cough, sore throat, or runny nose.  
- Mild fatigue or body aches.  
- Loss of smell or taste.  
- Mild headache or congestion.  

However, **seek urgent care** if you notice:
- Breathing difficulty or chest pain.  
- High, persistent fever not improving after two days.  
- Severe weakness, dehydration, or confusion.  
- Bluish lips or face.  

These are red-flag signs listed by the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-HomeCare-2024.1) that require prompt medical evaluation.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your doctor or emergency services **immediately** if you have:
- Shortness of breath or chest tightness.  
- Persistent vomiting, inability to eat or drink.  
- Drowsiness, confusion, or fainting.  
- Fever above 39 °C (102 °F) lasting more than two days.  
- Worsening cough with blood in sputum.  
- Severe pain or swelling anywhere in the body.  

People with heart, lung, kidney, or immune conditions should seek help sooner.

## Evidence-backed self-care
Based on WHO and CDC home-care protocols:
1. **Stay in a separate, well-ventilated room.** Open windows to allow airflow.  
2. **Keep a minimum distance** (1–2 meters / 6 feet) from others at home.  
3. **Wear a well-fitting mask** when near other people.  
4. **Use your own dishes, towels, and bedding.** Wash them separately.  
5. **Stay hydrated** — drink plenty of water, soups, or oral rehydration solutions.  
6. **Rest and monitor symptoms** twice daily (temperature, breathing rate, energy level).  
7. **Maintain hygiene:** cover coughs, wash hands often for 20 seconds with soap, disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.  
8. **Keep in touch with a healthcare provider** by phone for any changes.  

If isolation feels emotionally difficult, stay connected virtually with friends and family.

## Prevention / lifestyle
Guidelines from the [WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-HomeCare-2024.1) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/guidance/faqs.html) recommend:
- Stay home until symptoms improve **and** you have been fever-free for 24 hours without medicine.  
- Continue wearing a mask for a few days after recovery when around others.  
- Keep your living area clean, especially kitchen and bathroom surfaces.  
- Get vaccinated for preventable infections like influenza and COVID-19.  
- Maintain a balanced diet, regular sleep, and stress-reduction habits.  

These steps protect both you and your household members.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Keep mild-symptom children at home; ensure fluids, rest, and parental monitoring.  
- **Pregnancy:** Mild infections usually settle, but fever or breathlessness need prompt review.  
- **Older adults:** Check oxygen levels or breathing regularly; dehydration is a common risk.  
- **Chronic illness:** Continue prescribed medications and stay in contact with your regular doctor by phone.  
- **Mental health:** Isolation can be stressful; plan daily communication and relaxation routines.
