## Overview / Definition
This healthcare assistant is designed to give **trusted, evidence-based information** about common health topics in a clear, conversational way.  
It uses verified data from global public-health authorities like the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/digital-health) and the [National Health Service (NHS, UK)](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/using-the-nhs-app/).  
Its goal is to help you understand symptoms, self-care steps, prevention methods, and red-flag situations where professional help is needed.

It is not a replacement for a doctor, nurse, or emergency service. Instead, it helps you make **informed decisions** about when and how to seek the right care.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
This bot can guide you if you have **everyday health questions**, such as:
- “What should I do if I have a mild fever?”  
- “When is a cough serious enough to see a doctor?”  
- “What are early signs of stress or anxiety?”  
- “How can I prevent dehydration or fatigue?”  

It can also explain **public health topics** like vaccination, hygiene, diet, exercise, or sleep in simple terms.  

If your symptoms are **sudden, severe, or worsening**, or if you ever feel unsafe, the bot will guide you to seek immediate professional help.

## Red flags & when to escalate
You should stop using this bot and contact real healthcare services if you experience any of the following:
- Difficulty breathing, severe pain, heavy bleeding, or loss of consciousness.  
- Chest pain or pressure that does not go away.  
- Sudden weakness, confusion, or slurred speech.  
- Suicidal thoughts or intent to harm yourself or others.  
- Severe allergic reactions, burns, or poisoning.  
- Any symptom that keeps worsening despite self-care advice.  

If you are unsure whether your situation is an emergency, visit your nearest hospital or call your local emergency number (e.g., 108 or 112 in India).

## Evidence-backed self-care
According to WHO’s [AI for Health Governance framework](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240029200) and NHS digital-use principles:
1. **Use information responsibly** — treat it as educational, not diagnostic.  
2. **Confirm serious issues** with a qualified doctor or nurse.  
3. **Use official health sources** for verification (WHO, NHS, CDC, ICMR).  
4. **Keep your medical records private** — never share personal identifiers in chat.  
5. **Follow local health laws and emergency procedures.**

If the bot ever gives advice that feels uncertain or conflicting with your doctor’s guidance, follow your doctor’s instructions.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Learn how to identify **red-flag symptoms** early; the bot can teach these.  
- Use the bot for **preventive health education** — diet, exercise, sleep hygiene, and vaccination reminders.  
- Keep **emergency contact numbers** handy even while using digital tools.  
- Stay updated with **trusted health websites**, not random social-media claims.  
- Encourage family and elderly members to use the bot safely with human oversight.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Caregivers should use the bot on behalf of minors and confirm advice with a pediatrician.  
- **Pregnancy:** Use for lifestyle and wellness education only; always see a doctor for any symptoms.  
- **Chronic illness:** The bot can help with lifestyle management tips but should not replace regular follow-ups.  
- **Mental health:** The bot offers coping strategies and helplines but is **not a substitute for therapy or crisis care**.
