## Overview / Definition
A **cough** is your body’s natural reflex to clear the airways of mucus, irritants, or infection.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/acute-respiratory-infections), most acute coughs (lasting less than 3 weeks) are caused by **viral infections** like the common cold, flu, or other respiratory viruses.

Coughs usually resolve on their own, but if they persist or worsen, it may signal a more serious illness like pneumonia, whooping cough, or asthma.

---

## Common causes
Based on the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cough/), acute cough can occur due to:
- Viral infections (cold, flu, RSV, COVID-19)
- Mild bronchitis (inflammation of airways)
- Post-nasal drip (from allergies or sinus infection)
- Inhaled irritants like smoke or dust

Usually, symptoms improve within 1–2 weeks.

---

## Typical symptoms
- Dry or chesty cough  
- Mild sore throat or tiredness  
- Runny or blocked nose  
- Occasional mild fever  
- Chest discomfort or tickling feeling  

These are often self-limiting.

## Self-care / Evidence-based management
From the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html) and [NHS guidance](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cough/):
1. **Stay hydrated** – warm fluids help loosen mucus.  
2. **Rest and avoid smoke or strong odors.**  
3. **Honey (for adults)** can soothe throat irritation.  
4. **Paracetamol or ibuprofen** for fever or discomfort.  
5. **Avoid over-the-counter cough suppressants** unless advised by a clinician.  
6. **Practice good hygiene** – cover mouth when coughing, wash hands often.

Most people do not need antibiotics, as viral coughs do not respond to them.

## Red flags & when to seek urgent help
Call your doctor or local emergency number (108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, 911 in the US) **immediately** if you notice:
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing  
- Chest pain or tightness  
- Cough lasting longer than 3 weeks  
- Coughing up blood  
- High fever or confusion  
- Bluish lips or face  
- Wheezing that worsens or does not improve with rest  
- Swelling of the face or throat (possible allergic reaction)

## Prevention / lifestyle
From [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/acute-respiratory-infections) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/index.html):
- Wash hands frequently.  
- Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  
- Keep up to date with vaccines (flu, COVID-19, pertussis).  
- Ventilate rooms and avoid smoking indoors.  
- Wear a mask in crowded or unwell environments if coughing.

---

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Cough with noisy breathing, poor feeding, or bluish lips = emergency.  
- **Older adults:** Watch for confusion, weakness, or persistent breathlessness.  
- **Pregnant people:** Persistent cough or fever should be reviewed early.  
- **Asthma/COPD:** Any sudden worsening of cough or wheeze requires prompt medical review.
