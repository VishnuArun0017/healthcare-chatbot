## Overview / Definition
Mild shortness of breath (also called *breathlessness* or *dyspnea*) means feeling slightly unable to get enough air, especially during physical activity or stress.  
According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/), occasional breathlessness is common and often caused by being unfit, hot weather, anxiety, or mild respiratory infections.  
However, ongoing or worsening shortness of breath may indicate underlying conditions such as asthma, anemia, heart disease, or lung infection.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
As described by the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/chronic-respiratory-diseases):
- Feeling “out of breath” after light exertion.  
- Tightness or mild discomfort in the chest.  
- Breathing faster than usual, especially with minimal activity.  
- Difficulty taking a deep breath or yawning fully.  
- Tiredness or weakness during daily tasks.  
- Occasional wheezing or cough.  

If these symptoms occur frequently or limit normal activity, they require medical evaluation.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your local emergency number (108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, or 911 in the US) **immediately** if breathlessness:
- Comes on suddenly or severely.  
- Occurs at rest or wakes you from sleep.  
- Is accompanied by chest pain, pressure, or tightness.  
- Causes blue lips, fingers, or face.  
- Is linked with confusion, fainting, or extreme fatigue.  
- Follows exposure to smoke, chemicals, or an allergic trigger.  
- Occurs with coughing up blood or pink frothy sputum.  

These can signal serious problems such as asthma attack, heart failure, or pulmonary embolism.

## Evidence-backed self-care
For mild breathlessness due to fitness, stress, or mild infection, [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/first-aid/breathing-emergencies/index.html) suggest:
1. **Stay calm and control breathing:** Inhale slowly through your nose and exhale gently through pursed lips.  
2. **Sit upright** — avoid lying flat as it may make breathing harder.  
3. **Loosen tight clothing** to reduce chest restriction.  
4. **Open a window** or move to fresh air if indoors.  
5. **Stay hydrated** and avoid smoking or secondhand smoke.  
6. **Practice gentle exercise** (like walking or yoga) regularly to improve lung capacity.  
7. **Rest between activities** and pace yourself if recovering from illness.  

If symptoms persist for more than a few days or are recurrent, a doctor can check oxygen levels, lungs, or heart function.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Maintain regular physical activity to strengthen lungs.  
- Avoid smoking and exposure to pollutants.  
- Keep vaccinations up to date (influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal).  
- Manage stress and anxiety, as they can trigger breathlessness.  
- Maintain healthy weight to reduce strain on heart and lungs.  
- Treat allergies or asthma as advised by a healthcare provider.  

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Sudden breathlessness, wheezing, or fast breathing always needs urgent evaluation.  
- **Pregnancy:** Mild shortness of breath can be normal due to increased oxygen demand; sudden or severe symptoms need review.  
- **Older adults:** Breathlessness at rest may signal heart or lung disease — medical review is important.  
- **Chronic illness:** People with asthma, COPD, or heart disease should have an action plan and inhalers accessible.
