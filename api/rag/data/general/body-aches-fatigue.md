## Overview / Definition
Body aches and fatigue are common and usually temporary, often resulting from overwork, viral infections, dehydration, or lack of sleep.  
According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tiredness-and-fatigue/), most people feel tired at times, but ongoing tiredness or unexplained body aches may indicate an underlying health issue — such as infection, anemia, thyroid problems, depression, or chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Common causes
Based on [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tiredness-and-fatigue/) guidance:
- Viral illnesses such as flu, COVID-19, or common cold.  
- Poor sleep or irregular sleep schedules.  
- Dehydration or inadequate nutrition.  
- Excessive physical activity without rest.  
- Mental stress, anxiety, or depression.  
- Low iron levels (anemia).  
- Thyroid imbalance or hormonal issues.  
- Certain medications that cause drowsiness or muscle pain.

## Red flags & when to seek help
Seek medical review urgently if you notice:
- Severe, persistent fatigue lasting more than 2 weeks.  
- Muscle pain with high fever, rash, or dark urine (possible infection).  
- Unexplained weight loss or night sweats.  
- Shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations.  
- Swelling, joint pain, or weakness in limbs.  
- Tiredness accompanied by persistent sadness or hopelessness.  

If body aches follow heavy exercise, dehydration, or lack of rest, simple self-care may help — but any unexplained or worsening symptoms should not be ignored.

## Evidence-backed self-care
From [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tiredness-and-fatigue/) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity):
1. **Rest and sleep:** Aim for 7–9 hours per night; maintain a consistent bedtime.  
2. **Hydration:** Drink enough fluids; limit caffeine and alcohol.  
3. **Balanced diet:** Include fruits, vegetables, proteins, and iron-rich foods.  
4. **Light exercise:** Regular walks or stretching improve circulation and energy levels.  
5. **Relaxation:** Deep breathing or mindfulness can reduce tension and mental fatigue.  
6. **Avoid overuse of painkillers:** If frequent aches persist, seek medical advice instead.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Maintain a routine sleep–wake cycle.  
- Eat balanced meals and avoid skipping breakfast.  
- Stay active — aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly (WHO recommendation).  
- Stay hydrated and avoid excess caffeine.  
- Manage stress through hobbies or social interaction.  

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Persistent tiredness may indicate infection, poor diet, or lack of rest.  
- **Pregnancy:** Fatigue is common but should not cause fainting or breathlessness.  
- **Older adults:** Check for anemia, thyroid issues, or medication side effects.  
- **Post-viral recovery:** Rest adequately and return to activities gradually.
