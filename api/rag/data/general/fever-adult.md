## Overview / Definition
Fever means a temporary rise in body temperature, usually due to an infection or inflammation.  
Normal body temperature is around **37°C (98.6°F)**. A reading of **38°C (100.4°F) or above** generally indicates fever.

According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fever-in-adults/), fever itself is not an illness but a sign that your body is fighting something — commonly viral or bacterial infections.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
Typical signs that accompany fever include:
- Sweating, chills, or shivering  
- Headache and muscle aches  
- Fatigue or general weakness  
- Loss of appetite  
- Dehydration (dry mouth, reduced urination)  
- Flushed or warm skin  

If fever lasts more than **3 days**, or temperature repeatedly exceeds **39°C (102°F)**, medical review is recommended.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Seek urgent medical care or call your local emergency number if you experience:
- Fever above **40°C (104°F)** or not coming down with rest and fluids  
- Severe headache, neck stiffness, or light sensitivity (possible meningitis)  
- Shortness of breath, chest pain, or confusion  
- Persistent vomiting or diarrhea leading to dehydration  
- Rash that spreads rapidly or looks like bruising (possible sepsis or meningococcal infection)  
- Recent travel to malaria-endemic areas  
- Fever in a person with weak immunity (HIV, chemotherapy, diabetes)

## Evidence-backed self-care
If no red flags are present, self-care may help:
1. **Stay hydrated** – drink water or oral rehydration solutions.  
2. **Rest** – let your body recover.  
3. **Dress lightly** – avoid over-layering; use a light blanket.  
4. **Cool compress** – apply a damp cloth to forehead or neck.  
5. **Monitor temperature** – check every few hours.  
6. **Paracetamol or ibuprofen** (if not contraindicated) can be used for comfort, but only as directed by a professional.  

Never combine multiple fever medicines unless advised by a doctor.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Maintain hygiene — wash hands frequently with soap.  
- Keep vaccinations up to date.  
- Avoid sharing food or utensils when ill.  
- Manage stress and rest adequately to strengthen immunity.  
- Maintain a clean home environment to reduce infection spread.  

## Special considerations
- **Older adults:** Even mild fever can signal serious infection.  
- **Pregnancy:** Persistent fever may harm both mother and baby; seek review early.  
- **Chronic illness:** People with heart, lung, or kidney disease should be cautious.  
- **Travelers:** Report recent travel if fever occurs within 3 weeks of return.
