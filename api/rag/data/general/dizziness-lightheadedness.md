## Overview / Definition
Dizziness or lightheadedness is a feeling of unsteadiness, faintness, or a spinning sensation (vertigo).  
According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dizziness/), it is often temporary and caused by minor issues such as dehydration, standing up too quickly, or ear problems.  
However, sudden or persistent dizziness can indicate more serious conditions like low blood pressure, anemia, heart rhythm problems, or stroke.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
Based on [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dizziness/) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls) guidance:
- Feeling faint, unsteady, or as if the room is spinning.  
- Blurred vision or “blackout” sensation after standing.  
- Nausea or vomiting.  
- Loss of balance or difficulty walking straight.  
- Ringing in ears or hearing changes (suggestive of inner ear issues).  
- Headache or tightness in neck/shoulders.  

These symptoms are usually mild and short-lived, but can sometimes warn of serious underlying causes.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your local emergency number (108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, or 911 in the US) **immediately** if dizziness is accompanied by:
- Sudden severe headache or blurred/double vision.  
- Weakness or numbness on one side of the body.  
- Slurred speech, confusion, or difficulty walking straight.  
- Chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.  
- Fainting and not waking up promptly.  
- Persistent vomiting or severe dehydration.  
- Dizziness after head injury or fall.  

According to [NHS Dizziness](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dizziness/), even mild dizziness that doesn’t go away after a few days should be reviewed by a doctor.

## Evidence-backed self-care
If symptoms are mild and there are no red flags, the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dizziness/) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls) recommend:
1. **Sit or lie down immediately** when dizzy to prevent falls.  
2. **Stand up slowly** from sitting or lying positions.  
3. **Stay hydrated** — drink water regularly, especially in hot weather.  
4. **Eat regular meals** to avoid low blood sugar.  
5. **Avoid alcohol and caffeine**, which can worsen dehydration.  
6. **Rest your eyes** and avoid bright or flashing lights if you feel the room spinning.  
7. **Track your triggers** — such as standing too long, skipping meals, or stress.  

If dizziness continues, causes like ear infections, anemia, or medication side effects should be ruled out by a healthcare professional.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Maintain good hydration throughout the day.  
- Get up slowly, especially from bed in the morning.  
- Keep salt intake balanced (too low can drop blood pressure).  
- Avoid sudden head movements or looking up/down too quickly.  
- Regular exercise to improve balance and blood circulation.  
- Ensure adequate sleep and manage stress.  
- Use sturdy footwear and handrails to prevent falls if you feel unsteady.  

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Dizziness may indicate dehydration, ear infection, or skipped meals.  
- **Pregnancy:** Common due to low blood pressure or anemia; ensure hydration and rest.  
- **Older adults:** Increased fall risk; always check blood pressure, medications, and hydration.  
- **Chronic illnesses:** People with diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid disorders should review dizziness with their doctor promptly.
