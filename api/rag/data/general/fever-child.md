## Overview / Definition
Fever in children means a body temperature of **38°C (100.4°F) or higher**, usually due to an infection.  
According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fever-in-children/), fever is a common sign that a child’s body is fighting an infection — often viral, such as cold or flu.

Most fevers are harmless and resolve on their own, but some may indicate serious illness, especially in babies and very young children.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
Typical signs of fever in children include:
- Warm or flushed skin  
- Sweating or shivering  
- Tiredness or irritability  
- Poor feeding or reduced appetite  
- Faster breathing or heartbeat  
- Feeling generally unwell or sleepy  

You can check temperature using a digital thermometer under the arm (for children under 5).

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your doctor or emergency service **immediately** if your child:
- Is **under 3 months old** with a temperature of **38°C or higher**  
- Is **3–6 months old** with a temperature of **39°C or higher**  
- Has a **rash** that does not fade when pressed (possible meningitis/sepsis)  
- Is **very drowsy, unresponsive, or floppy**  
- Has **trouble breathing**, grunting, or pauses in breathing  
- Has **seizures (fits)**  
- Has **persistent vomiting, dehydration**, or refusal to drink  
- Has a **high-pitched cry** or appears inconsolable  
- Is **extremely cold, pale, or mottled**

## Evidence-backed self-care
If no red flags are present:
1. **Keep your child comfortable** — don’t overwrap; use light clothing.  
2. **Encourage fluids** — water, breast milk, or formula to prevent dehydration.  
3. **Monitor temperature** every few hours.  
4. **Let them rest** — rest helps recovery.  
5. **Use paracetamol or ibuprofen only if advised** for comfort, never to “normalize” temperature.  
6. **Never give aspirin** to children under 16.  

If fever lasts **more than 5 days**, contact a doctor.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Keep vaccinations up to date.  
- Encourage frequent handwashing.  
- Maintain good nutrition and sleep routines.  
- Avoid exposure to sick individuals when possible.  
- Keep the home well-ventilated.  

## Special considerations
- **Infants (<3 months):** Always consider fever as an emergency.  
- **Children with chronic illness:** Fever can worsen underlying conditions; seek advice early.  
- **Post-vaccination:** Mild fever for up to 48 hours is common; monitor and comfort.  
- **Travel-related:** If returning from malaria or dengue-endemic regions, urgent review is needed.
