## Overview / Definition
Chest pain can have many causes, ranging from mild muscle strain to life-threatening heart or lung emergencies.  
According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-pain/), any new, severe, or persistent chest discomfort should be checked urgently, especially if it happens suddenly or during activity.

The [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/emergency-care) notes that rapid assessment is crucial, as early care can prevent death or long-term damage.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
From [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-pain/) and [CDC Heart Disease Guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/signs_symptoms.htm):
- Tightness, pressure, heaviness, or squeezing in the chest.  
- Pain radiating to the arm, jaw, neck, back, or stomach.  
- Shortness of breath, sweating, or nausea with chest discomfort.  
- Pain that worsens with activity or doesn’t go away with rest.  
- Chest pain after injury or persistent cough.

Mild, brief twinges of chest pain may be non-serious (like muscle strain or indigestion), but it’s *safer to get checked* if the cause is uncertain.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Call your local emergency number (108 or 112 in India, 999 in the UK, or 911 in the US) **immediately** if:
- The chest pain feels heavy, tight, or like pressure on the chest.  
- Pain spreads to your arms, neck, jaw, or back.  
- You are breathless, sweaty, or feel sick or faint.  
- Pain began suddenly and is severe or does not go away.  
- You have a history of heart disease or risk factors (like diabetes, smoking, or high blood pressure).  
- You feel an irregular or very fast heartbeat with pain.  
- You cough up blood or experience severe shortness of breath.

These symptoms may indicate a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, or another serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.

## Evidence-backed self-care (if symptoms are mild and non-cardiac)
If your pain is mild and already assessed as non-cardiac by a healthcare professional:
1. **Rest and avoid exertion** until evaluated.  
2. **Use pain relief** like paracetamol or ibuprofen (as advised by a doctor).  
3. **Avoid large meals, alcohol, or smoking** if pain is related to indigestion.  
4. **Track triggers** — note when and how the pain occurs.  
5. **Seek follow-up** if pain persists beyond a few days or worsens.

Never ignore or “wait out” new chest pain without evaluation.

## Prevention / lifestyle
Based on [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/heart-health/):
- Maintain a heart-healthy diet (fruits, vegetables, low salt).  
- Exercise regularly but within medical advice limits.  
- Quit smoking and reduce alcohol intake.  
- Manage stress and get enough sleep.  
- Control blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes through regular checkups.

## Special considerations
- **Women:** May have subtle symptoms (fatigue, shortness of breath, back pain) instead of classic chest pressure.  
- **Older adults:** Can present with confusion, weakness, or fainting instead of pain.  
- **People with diabetes:** May have “silent” heart attacks with minimal pain.  
- **Children:** Chest pain is rarely cardiac, but persistent or severe pain still needs review.
