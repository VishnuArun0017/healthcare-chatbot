## Overview / Definition
A **sore throat** (pharyngitis) is pain, irritation, or scratchiness in the throat that often worsens when swallowing.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/upper-respiratory-tract-infections), most sore throats are part of **upper respiratory infections** (URTIs), commonly caused by viruses such as the cold or flu.

Most cases improve within a week, but some bacterial infections (like strep throat) may require antibiotics.

---

## Common causes
From the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sore-throat/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/diseases-public/strep-throat.html):
- **Viral infections:** Cold, flu, COVID-19, mononucleosis.  
- **Bacterial infections:** Group A Streptococcus (strep throat).  
- **Environmental irritants:** Smoke, pollution, dry air, or shouting.  
- **Allergies:** Post-nasal drip or allergic rhinitis.  

---

## Typical symptoms
- Pain or scratchy sensation in throat.  
- Difficulty or pain when swallowing.  
- Swollen neck glands.  
- Hoarseness or mild cough.  
- Red or inflamed throat on inspection.  
- Occasionally, fever or fatigue.

## Self-care / Evidence-based management
Based on [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sore-throat/) and [CDC recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html):
1. **Stay hydrated** – warm fluids (water, tea, soup) soothe the throat.  
2. **Gargle with warm salt water** (½ tsp in a glass of warm water).  
3. **Take paracetamol or ibuprofen** for pain and fever.  
4. **Use throat lozenges** or warm honey (for adults, not under 1 year).  
5. **Rest your voice** and get adequate sleep.  
6. **Avoid irritants** like smoke or strong perfumes.  
7. **Humidify your room air** if the environment is dry.  

Most sore throats improve in **3–7 days** without antibiotics.

## Red flags & when to seek urgent help
Call your doctor or local emergency number (108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, 911 in the US) **immediately** if:
- You have **difficulty breathing or swallowing.**  
- There is **drooling** (especially in children) or you can’t swallow liquids.  
- You experience **severe throat pain** with high fever.  
- There is **swelling of the neck or tongue**, or **voice changes** (muffled voice).  
- You notice **blood in saliva** or pus-filled spots in the throat.  
- Symptoms last **more than 1 week** or keep returning.

## Prevention / lifestyle
From [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/upper-respiratory-tract-infections) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html):
- Wash hands regularly with soap and water.  
- Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  
- Do not share utensils, cups, or towels.  
- Keep your environment smoke-free.  
- Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.  
- Stay home and rest when unwell to prevent spreading infection.  

---

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Sore throat with fever, rash, or refusal to eat may indicate strep throat — needs prompt medical review.  
- **Pregnancy:** Persistent fever or dehydration should be evaluated early.  
- **Older adults:** A sore throat with weight loss or persistent hoarseness warrants further assessment.  
- **Low immunity:** People with weakened immune systems (e.g., diabetes, HIV, cancer) should not delay care for prolonged or severe sore throats.
