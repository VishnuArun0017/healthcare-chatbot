## Overview / Definition
A **runny nose** (rhinorrhea) and **common cold** are among the most frequent mild respiratory illnesses.  
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/upper-respiratory-tract-infections), they are caused by **viruses** (mainly rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, or influenza viruses) that infect the upper airways — the nose, throat, and sinuses.

Most people recover naturally within **7–10 days** with rest and home care.

---

## Common causes
From the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/common-cold/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/):
- **Viral infections:** Rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, or parainfluenza virus.  
- **Environmental irritants:** Smoke, strong odors, pollution.  
- **Allergies:** Often mistaken for cold; may cause clear nasal discharge and sneezing.  
- **Cold or dry air:** Can irritate nasal passages and trigger mild congestion.

---

## Typical symptoms
- Runny or stuffy nose.  
- Sneezing and mild sore throat.  
- Cough (dry or productive).  
- Watery eyes.  
- Mild headache or body aches.  
- Low-grade fever (sometimes).  
- Fatigue and loss of smell or taste (temporary).  

Most symptoms peak within 2–3 days and gradually improve.

## Evidence-backed self-care
Based on [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/common-cold/) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/):
1. **Stay hydrated** – drink plenty of fluids to loosen mucus.  
2. **Rest well** – sleep helps your immune system fight infection.  
3. **Use saline nasal sprays** or inhaling steam for relief.  
4. **Take paracetamol or ibuprofen** for fever or discomfort.  
5. **Use honey and warm drinks** to soothe sore throat or cough (not for children under 1 year).  
6. **Avoid antibiotics** – colds are viral, not bacterial.  
7. **Keep air moist** with a humidifier or steam bowl.  

Avoid combining multiple cold medications without medical advice.

## Red flags & when to seek medical help
Call or see a healthcare professional if you notice:
- Symptoms lasting **more than 10 days** or getting worse.  
- **High fever (>102°F / 39°C)** not responding to medication.

- **Ear pain** or yellow/green nasal discharge with facial pain (possible sinus infection).  
- **Severe sore throat** with difficulty swallowing.

## Prevention / lifestyle
From [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/upper-respiratory-tract-infections) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/):
- Wash hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds.  
- Avoid touching your face (especially eyes, nose, and mouth).  
- Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.  
- Dispose of tissues properly and clean surfaces regularly.  
- Stay away from crowded places if you are unwell.  
- Get vaccinated against flu and COVID-19 where applicable.  

---

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Colds are common; watch for ear infections or breathing difficulty.  
- **Pregnancy:** Avoid unnecessary medications; use saline sprays and rest.  
- **Older adults:** Be cautious of complications like bronchitis or pneumonia.  
- **Asthma or chronic lung disease:** Cold viruses can trigger flare-ups — keep rescue medication ready.
