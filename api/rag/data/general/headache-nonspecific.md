## Overview / Definition
A non-specific headache is any pain or discomfort felt in the head, scalp, or neck that isn’t clearly linked to a specific underlying disease.  
According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/headache-disorders) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/headaches/), most headaches are not dangerous and improve with rest, fluids, and stress relief.

Common short-term causes include tension, dehydration, lack of sleep, eye strain, skipping meals, or stress.

## Common symptoms / warning signs
Typical features of non-specific headaches:
- Dull or pressure-like pain on both sides of the head or across the forehead.  
- Tightness or heaviness in the scalp or neck muscles.  
- Mild to moderate intensity, lasting a few hours to a few days.  
- May worsen with stress or long screen time.  
- Often relieved by rest, hydration, or gentle stretching.

## Red flags & when to escalate
Seek **urgent medical attention** (call 108/112 in India, 999 in the UK, or 911 in the US) if:
- Headache starts suddenly and feels like the “worst ever.”  
- It comes after a head injury, fall, or blow.  
- Pain is accompanied by vision loss, confusion, weakness, or slurred speech.  
- There is fever, neck stiffness, or sensitivity to light (possible meningitis).  
- New headache occurs in pregnancy or with high blood pressure.  
- Headache wakes you from sleep or steadily worsens despite rest.  
- Vomiting without relief or loss of consciousness occurs.  

These signs could suggest a serious condition such as bleeding, infection, or high pressure in the brain.

## Evidence-backed self-care
Based on [NHS guidance](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/headaches/):
1. **Rest and relax** in a quiet, dark room.  
2. **Stay hydrated** — drink plenty of water.  
3. **Avoid skipping meals** — low blood sugar can trigger headaches.  
4. **Use a cold or warm compress** on the forehead or neck.  
5. **Maintain good posture** while working or studying.  
6. **Limit caffeine and screen time.**  
7. **Sleep well** — aim for 7–8 hours nightly.  

If headaches occur often, keep a diary of triggers and patterns to discuss with a clinician.

## Prevention / lifestyle
- Manage stress with deep breathing, yoga, or gentle physical activity.  
- Maintain regular sleep and meal schedules.  
- Stay hydrated, especially in hot weather.  
- Adjust computer screens to eye level and take short breaks.  
- Regular exercise and balanced diet improve overall well-being.

## Special considerations
- **Children:** Frequent headaches can relate to dehydration or vision issues.  
- **Pregnancy:** Avoid self-medicating; persistent headache with swelling or visual symptoms needs urgent review.  
- **Older adults:** Sudden new headache can signal vascular or eye conditions; prompt evaluation advised.  
- **Chronic illness:** People with hypertension or diabetes should check blood pressure and glucose when headaches occur.
