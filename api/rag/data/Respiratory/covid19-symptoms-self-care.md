## Overview / Definition

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  
It spreads mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact with infected individuals.  
Most people experience mild or moderate illness and recover at home, while some—especially older adults or those with chronic illnesses—may develop severe symptoms requiring medical care.

## Evidence-backed self-care

If your symptoms are mild and you are managing COVID-19 at home:

1. **Isolate yourself**  
   Stay in a separate, well-ventilated room. Avoid close contact with family members and pets.  
2. **Monitor your symptoms daily**  
   Check temperature, oxygen levels if available, and breathing rate.  
3. **Stay hydrated and rest well**  
   Drink plenty of fluids, eat nutritious foods, and get adequate sleep.  
4. **Keep air clean and ventilated**  
   Open windows regularly for fresh airflow. Avoid smoke and indoor pollutants.  
5. **Wear a mask** when around others, even at home.  
6. **Stay connected**  
   Communicate with family or healthcare providers virtually for updates and guidance.  

If your symptoms worsen, do not delay medical evaluation.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations and booster doses.  
- Wash hands regularly with soap or use sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.  
- Avoid touching your face, especially eyes, nose, and mouth.  
- Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance from others in public spaces.  
- Wear a well-fitting mask in crowded or poorly ventilated areas.  
- Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces daily.  
- Maintain good physical health—eat balanced meals, exercise moderately, and get enough rest.

## Special considerations

- **Older adults and chronic illness patients**: Monitor symptoms closely and consult your doctor early.  
- **Pregnant individuals**: Seek specific medical advice before using any medicines or supplements.  
- **Children**: Most develop mild symptoms, but caregivers should watch for dehydration or laboured breathing.  
- **Post-COVID recovery**: Persistent fatigue or breathlessness may require follow-up (known as long COVID).  
- **Voice-first and multilingual support**: Use short, clear phrases such as “Wear a mask,” “Check your temperature,” or “Call emergency help.” Avoid complex medical terms to aid translation and accessibility.
