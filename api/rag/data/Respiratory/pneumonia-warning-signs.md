## Overview / Definition

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs.  
The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.  
It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and can range from mild to life-threatening.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

Recognizing early symptoms helps prevent serious illness:

- Cough with phlegm or mucus (sometimes with blood streaks)  
- Fever, sweating, and chills  
- Shortness of breath, rapid or shallow breathing  
- Chest pain that worsens when breathing or coughing  
- Fatigue, weakness, or confusion (especially in older adults)  
- Loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting  

Symptoms can appear suddenly or develop gradually over several days.

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek **immediate medical care** if any of the following occur:

- Difficulty breathing or feeling unable to catch your breath  
- Chest pain that is sharp, severe, or radiates to the shoulder or back  
- Persistent high fever (>39°C or 102°F) or chills that do not improve  
- Bluish lips, tongue, or fingertips (a sign of low oxygen)  
- Confusion, disorientation, or drowsiness (especially in elderly people)  
- Severe weakness, rapid heartbeat, or dizziness  
- Symptoms that worsen after a flu or cold  

Children, pregnant individuals, and adults over 60 should seek medical help early even for mild symptoms.

## Evidence-backed self-care

If diagnosed with mild pneumonia and advised home recovery:

1. **Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions** completely.  
2. **Rest well** — your body needs energy to fight the infection.  
3. **Stay hydrated** — drink plenty of water and warm fluids to loosen mucus.  
4. **Monitor temperature and breathing** — if either worsens, contact your doctor.  
5. **Avoid smoking or exposure to smoke** — it can worsen lung inflammation.  
6. **Eat light, nutritious food** and maintain good airflow in your room.  
7. **Complete prescribed antibiotic or antiviral course fully** (if provided).  

If symptoms persist or worsen, go for re-evaluation without delay.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- **Vaccination**: Get vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal infections.  
- **Hygiene**: Wash hands frequently and use masks when sick to reduce spread.  
- **Avoid smoking** and second-hand smoke exposure — smoking damages lung defenses.  
- **Manage chronic illnesses** such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease properly.  
- **Good nutrition and exercise** support immunity and faster recovery.  
- **Clean indoor air** — ventilate living spaces and avoid indoor pollution sources.

## Special considerations

- **Infants and young children:** Fast breathing, chest indrawing, and inability to feed are serious warning signs needing urgent care.  
- **Older adults:** May show unusual symptoms such as confusion or mild cough without fever.  
- **People with chronic lung, heart, or immune conditions:** More likely to develop severe pneumonia — monitor closely.  
- **Pregnancy:** Seek prompt medical evaluation for fever, breathlessness, or chest pain.  
- **Voice-first / multilingual settings:** Use simple, clear phrases like “Chest pain,” “Breathing fast,” “Call for help.” Avoid abbreviations.
