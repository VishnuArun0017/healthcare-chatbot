## Overview / Definition

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  
It mainly affects the lungs (pulmonary TB), but can also affect other organs like the brain, spine, or kidneys.  
TB spreads through the air when a person with active TB coughs, sneezes, or speaks.  
It is **curable and preventable** with timely diagnosis and proper treatment.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

Typical symptoms of **active pulmonary TB** include:

- Persistent cough for more than 2–3 weeks  
- Coughing up phlegm or blood  
- Chest pain or discomfort while breathing or coughing  
- Unexplained weight loss  
- Night sweats  
- Fever, tiredness, or general weakness  
- Loss of appetite  

Children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals may have milder or atypical symptoms.

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek **immediate medical help** if you experience:

- Cough lasting longer than 2–3 weeks  
- Cough with blood or chest pain  
- High fever with night sweats and weight loss  
- Difficulty breathing or worsening weakness  
- If you are living with HIV, diabetes, or on long-term immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., steroids)  

Contact the nearest government TB center or hospital for **free testing and treatment**.  
In India, services are available through the **National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP)**.

## Evidence-backed self-care

If diagnosed with TB and advised home care:

1. **Take all medicines exactly as prescribed** — do not skip or stop early.  
2. **Complete the full treatment course** (usually 6–9 months) to prevent relapse or drug resistance.  
3. **Cover your mouth** when coughing or sneezing; use tissues or masks to prevent spread.  
4. **Ensure good ventilation** — open windows to allow fresh air and sunlight.  
5. **Eat a balanced diet** with adequate protein, fruits, and vegetables to regain strength.  
6. **Avoid smoking and alcohol** — both weaken lungs and slow recovery.  
7. **Attend regular follow-ups** for sputum tests and health checks.  

All TB care and medicines are provided **free of cost** in government centers under NTEP.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- **Early detection**: Anyone with cough >2 weeks should get tested.  
- **BCG vaccination**: Protects young children from severe forms of TB.  
- **Good ventilation**: Keep homes and workplaces airy and well-lit.  
- **Wear masks** if you have symptoms or are around people with TB.  
- **Healthy lifestyle**: Eat nutritious food and manage chronic diseases like diabetes.  
- **Avoid close contact** with untreated TB patients until they start medication.  

TB is **not spread by shaking hands, sharing utensils, or touching surfaces**.

## Special considerations

- **Children:** More vulnerable to severe TB (e.g., meningitis); BCG vaccination is vital.  
- **HIV-positive individuals:** Need regular TB screening and preventive therapy as advised.  
- **Drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB):** Requires longer treatment; never stop medicines early.  
- **Pregnancy:** TB treatment is safe under medical supervision — do not delay care.  
- **Voice-first / multilingual use:** Use clear language like “Long cough,” “Free TB test,” “Take full treatment.”  
  Avoid abbreviations or slang to ensure clarity across languages and accessibility.
