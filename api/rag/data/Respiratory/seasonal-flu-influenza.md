## Overview / Definition

Seasonal influenza (flu) is a contagious viral infection that affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs.  
It spreads easily from person to person through droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.  
Flu can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to complications such as pneumonia, especially in children, older adults, and people with chronic conditions.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

Most people develop symptoms **1–4 days** after infection, including:

- Sudden fever (high temperature, chills)  
- Cough (usually dry)  
- Sore throat  
- Runny or blocked nose  
- Muscle or body aches  
- Headache  
- Fatigue or weakness  
- Occasionally vomiting or diarrhoea (more common in children)  

Symptoms often appear suddenly and can make you feel very unwell.

## Red flags & when to escalate

Contact a doctor or emergency services immediately if you or someone you care for develops:

- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath  
- Persistent chest or abdominal pain  
- Confusion, dizziness, or fainting  
- Blue or pale lips, face, or fingertips  
- High fever that does not improve with self-care  
- Severe weakness or inability to eat/drink  
- Worsening symptoms after initial improvement (possible pneumonia)  

High-risk individuals (infants, elderly, pregnant persons, and those with chronic diseases) should seek early medical evaluation even for mild symptoms.

## Evidence-backed self-care

If you have mild flu symptoms and do not require hospital care:

1. **Rest well** — allow your body to recover.  
2. **Stay hydrated** — drink warm fluids and water frequently.  
3. **Monitor your temperature** and breathing regularly.  
4. **Stay home** — avoid close contact with others until fever has resolved for at least 24 hours without medicine.  
5. **Use tissues or elbows** when coughing or sneezing; dispose of tissues immediately.  
6. **Avoid smoking or alcohol**, which can weaken recovery.  
7. **Eat light, balanced meals** rich in fruits, vegetables, and fluids.

## Prevention / lifestyle

- **Vaccination**: Get the seasonal flu vaccine every year; it’s the best protection.  
- **Hygiene**: Wash hands often with soap or use alcohol-based sanitizer.  
- **Masking & ventilation**: Wear a mask in crowded spaces and ensure good airflow indoors.  
- **Avoid close contact** with people who are sick.  
- **Cover coughs/sneezes** and clean frequently touched objects like phones and handles.  
- **Healthy lifestyle**: Adequate sleep, balanced diet, and regular exercise strengthen your immune system.

## Special considerations

- **Children:** Watch for fast breathing, refusal to feed, or unusual sleepiness — these may signal complications.  
- **Older adults:** Fever may be absent; confusion or sudden weakness could indicate flu complications.  
- **Pregnancy:** Flu can be more severe; vaccination and early care are recommended.  
- **Chronic illness:** People with asthma, diabetes, or heart/lung disease are at higher risk.  
- **Voice-first or multilingual systems:** Use short, clear instructions — “Drink water,” “Rest well,” “Call doctor if breathing hard.” Avoid complex or slang terms.
