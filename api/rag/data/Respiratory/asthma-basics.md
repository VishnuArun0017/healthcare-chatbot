## Overview / Definition

Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the airways of the lungs.  
These airways become inflamed and narrow, making it harder to breathe.  
It often causes episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.  
Asthma affects people of all ages but often starts in childhood.  
Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be controlled with proper care and awareness.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing)  
- Coughing, often at night or early morning  
- Chest tightness or heaviness  
- Shortness of breath, especially after activity or exposure to triggers  
Symptoms may come and go and vary in intensity.

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek urgent medical help if:  
- You have severe shortness of breath or cannot speak full sentences  
- Your lips, tongue, or fingertips turn pale, grey, or blue  
- Your reliever inhaler (if prescribed) is not helping or you need it repeatedly  
- You feel drowsy, confused, or your chest pain spreads to your arms or back  

These are signs of a serious asthma attack requiring emergency care.

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Identify and avoid personal triggers such as dust, smoke, pets, or air pollution  
- Follow your asthma action plan made with your doctor  
- Use inhalers or prescribed devices correctly and regularly  
- Monitor symptoms and seek review if control worsens  
- Maintain overall lung health by not smoking and staying active

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Avoid tobacco smoke and indoor air pollution  
- Maintain a clean environment to reduce dust and mould  
- Exercise regularly under guidance to strengthen lungs  
- Keep vaccinations up to date to prevent respiratory infections  
- Regularly check inhaler technique and update your care plan

## Special considerations

- Asthma may require special monitoring during pregnancy or in older adults  
- Children may need caregiver support for regular inhaler use  
- Cold weather, stress, and viral infections can worsen symptoms  
- Multilingual and voice-based education tools can help people understand asthma care better
