## Overview / Definition

An asthma attack (also called an asthma exacerbation) is when the airways in the lungs become severely narrowed, swollen, and filled with mucus.  
This makes breathing difficult and can quickly become life-threatening.  
Immediate first aid and professional medical care are essential.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

Recognizing the early signs of an asthma attack helps act fast:

- Wheezing or whistling sound when breathing  
- Tightness or heaviness in the chest  
- Persistent coughing, especially at night or early morning  
- Shortness of breath or rapid breathing  
- Difficulty speaking full sentences  
- Anxiety or distress due to breathlessness

## Red flags & when to escalate

Call **emergency medical help immediately** (e.g., 999 in UK, 112 in Europe, 108 in India) if:

- Breathing is extremely difficult or fast  
- The person cannot speak or finish a sentence  
- Lips, tongue, or fingertips appear blue or pale  
- Reliever inhaler (blue inhaler) is not improving symptoms  
- The person appears drowsy, confused, or collapses  

Never delay emergency help during a severe asthma episode.

## Evidence-backed self-care (First Aid Steps)

If someone is having an asthma attack:

1. **Sit them upright** — do not lie them down. Sitting upright helps the lungs expand.  
2. **Stay calm and reassure** — anxiety worsens breathing difficulty.  
3. **Assist them to use their reliever inhaler (usually blue)**  
   - Give 1 puff every 30–60 seconds (up to 10 puffs total) using a spacer if available.  
   - If symptoms persist, repeat after 5–10 minutes.  
4. **Monitor continuously** — note breathing, color, ability to talk.  
5. **Call emergency help immediately** if there’s no improvement after 10 puffs or if symptoms worsen.  
6. **Continue giving inhaler puffs every few minutes** until professional help arrives.

## Prevention / lifestyle

After the attack:

- Review your **asthma action plan** with a doctor or asthma nurse.  
- Check **inhaler technique** to ensure medication reaches the lungs properly.  
- Avoid **known triggers** like smoke, cold air, and strong odors.  
- Keep reliever inhaler accessible at all times.  
- Schedule a **follow-up appointment** within 24–48 hours after any asthma attack.  
- Maintain clean indoor air quality and reduce dust and mold.

## Special considerations

- **Children:** May not describe symptoms clearly. Watch for rapid breathing, coughing, and tiredness.  
- **Pregnancy:** Asthma may worsen; proper inhaler use and emergency readiness are crucial.  
- **Older adults:** Reduced lung function may delay recognition—monitor more closely.  
- **Voice-first assistants:** Use clear, short instructions during emergencies, e.g.,  
  “Sit upright. Take one puff. Wait thirty seconds. Repeat.”  
- **Community health training:** Teaching asthma first aid in local languages improves survival rates globally.
