## Overview / Definition

Allergic Rhinitis — often known as hay fever — is an allergic condition where the body’s immune system overreacts to harmless substances such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or mould.  
This immune response causes inflammation of the nasal passages, leading to sneezing, itching, congestion, and a runny nose.  
It can be **seasonal** (linked to pollen) or **perennial** (year-round).

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Repeated sneezing, especially after allergen exposure  
- Runny, itchy, or blocked nose  
- Itchy, red, or watery eyes  
- Itchy throat, ears, or roof of the mouth  
- Post-nasal drip (mucus in the back of the throat)  
- Disturbed sleep or reduced concentration due to congestion  

Symptoms are usually mild to moderate but can affect daily life, focus, and sleep quality.

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek medical advice if:  
- Symptoms persist despite allergen avoidance and over-the-counter medicines  
- You experience **facial pain, sinus pressure, or fever** (possible sinus infection)  
- Breathing becomes difficult or you develop **wheezing or chest tightness** (possible asthma link)  
- Symptoms disrupt sleep, school, or work frequently  
- Nasal symptoms occur with ear pain or chronic cough

## Evidence-backed self-care

To manage allergic rhinitis safely:

1. **Avoid known allergens**  
   - Keep windows closed during high pollen seasons  
   - Use dust-mite-proof bedding and wash weekly in hot water  
   - Limit pet access to sleeping areas  

2. **Rinse nasal passages**  
   - Use sterile saline spray or nasal irrigation to clear allergens and mucus  

3. **Monitor air quality**  
   - Use air purifiers or HEPA filters indoors  
   - Track daily pollen counts online  

4. **Follow a consistent care plan**  
   - Use prescribed or pharmacist-recommended nasal sprays or antihistamines  
   - Avoid irritants such as smoke, perfumes, and strong odors

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Stay indoors during high pollen counts and windy weather  
- Shower and change clothes after being outside to remove pollen  
- Keep living areas clean and well-ventilated  
- Maintain healthy sleep, nutrition, and exercise habits to support immunity  
- Discuss allergen immunotherapy (desensitization) with a specialist if symptoms persist

## Special considerations

- **Children:** Allergic rhinitis can affect concentration, sleep, and school performance.  
  Parents should ensure consistent management and review for co-existing asthma or eczema.  
- **Older adults:** Symptoms may overlap with non-allergic rhinitis or medication side effects.  
- **Pregnancy:** Seek medical advice before using any medication.  
- **Multilingual / voice-first systems:** Use short, clear instructions like “Avoid pollen,” “Clean bedding weekly,” and “Use nasal spray.”  
  Avoid jargon; ensure accurate translations for terms like “allergen,” “nasal congestion,” and “hay fever.”
