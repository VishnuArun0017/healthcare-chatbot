## Overview / Definition

Most diarrhoea in children is **viral gastroenteritis**.  
Main risk: **dehydration**, especially in infants.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Watery stool, vomiting, tummy cramps  
- Fever, irritability, poor feeding  
- Few or no wet nappies, dry mouth, sunken eyes

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek urgent care if:
- <12 months old with persistent vomiting or diarrhoea  
- Blood or green vomit, or very sleepy  
- No urine for 6+ hours  
- Symptoms >3 days or worsening  

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Offer **small, frequent sips** of water or oral rehydration  
- Continue breastfeeding/formula  
- Keep at home 48 hours after last symptom  
- Wash hands, clean surfaces  

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Rotavirus vaccination per national schedule  
- Hand hygiene, safe food handling  

## Special considerations

Infants, chronically ill, or immunocompromised children need earlier medical advice.
