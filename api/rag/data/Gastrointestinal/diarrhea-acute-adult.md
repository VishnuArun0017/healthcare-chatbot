## Overview / Definition

Acute diarrhoea means **frequent loose or watery stools lasting less than 14 days**.  
Most cases result from infection (“stomach bug”) and resolve within a few days.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Loose or watery stools, cramps, or bloating  
- Nausea, vomiting, tiredness  
- Possible fever  
- Thirst, dry mouth, dizziness — signs of dehydration

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek **urgent care** if:
- Blood or black stool  
- High fever, worsening pain  
- Diarrhoea lasting more than 3 days  
- No urination for 8+ hours or severe weakness

## Evidence-backed self-care

- Drink fluids frequently; use oral rehydration solution if available  
- Rest and stay home until **48 hours after** symptoms stop  
- Wash hands with soap, clean toilets/surfaces  
- Eat small, light meals as tolerated  

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Wash hands and prepare food safely  
- Avoid unsafe water and street food  
- Stay off work until fully recovered  

## Special considerations

Older adults, pregnant people, or those with chronic disease can dehydrate faster — seek care early.
