## Overview / Definition

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a **bacterial infection of the bladder or urethra**.  
It is common in women due to shorter urethral length.

## Common symptoms / warning signs

- Burning or pain when peeing  
- Needing to pee more often or urgently  
- Cloudy, dark, or strong-smelling urine  
- Lower tummy pain or pressure  

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek urgent care if:
- Fever, chills, or back pain (possible kidney infection)  
- Blood in urine  
- Unable to pass urine or pain that worsens  
- Pregnant or diabetic with symptoms  

## Evidence-backed self-care

- **Hydrate** with water throughout the day  
- **Do not delay urination**  
- Wipe **front to back** after toileting  
- Cotton underwear, avoid tight clothes  

## Prevention / lifestyle

- Empty bladder before and after sex  
- Avoid scented washes in genital area  
- Drink enough fluids daily  

## Special considerations

- Pregnancy increases risk — any UTI symptoms should be checked promptly  
- Recurrent UTIs may need specialist review
