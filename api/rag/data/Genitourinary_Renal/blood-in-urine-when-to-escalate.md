## Overview / Definition

Blood in urine (haematuria) may appear **red, pink, or tea-coloured**.  
Even small amounts can indicate infection, stones, or kidney disease.

## Common symptoms

- Visible red or brown urine  
- Burning or frequency when peeing  
- Flank or lower back pain  

## Red flags & when to escalate

Seek **urgent evaluation** if:
- Any visible blood in urine  
- Recurrent episodes  
- Pain with fever or weight loss  
- History of smoking or age >45  

## Self-care

- Stay hydrated  
- Avoid delaying assessment — do not self-treat as “just infection”  

## Prevention
